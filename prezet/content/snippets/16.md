Hi,

If you have ever face such kinds of the issue where you are trying use `getStatusCode()` is guzzle, however, you are always getting default laravel error page, then this post will help you.

In my case, I am using __klaviyo__ api services to access. But when someone provides the wrong api key, I am getting the following errors-

```
GuzzleHttp\Exception\ClientException
Client error: `GET https://a.klaviyo.com/api/v2/lists?api_key=pk_068860eadc7b016aa81c312e203e82ac3c` resulted in a `403 FORBIDDEN` response: {"message":"The API key specified is invalid."}
```
Actually I don't have any clue why the `getStatusCode()` doesn't trigger the error code instead of default and scary error code.

Then I figure it out a way by adding `'http_errors' => false` line in every request. So, here is my updated code-

```
$client->get('https://a.klaviyo.com/api/v2/lists?api_key=myWrongAPIKey', ['http_errors' => false]);
```

Now you will get expected `getStatusCode()` even if it fails to connect with the server.

Hope it will work for you.

Thanks.
