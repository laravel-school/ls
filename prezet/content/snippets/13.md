Hi,

If you want to use `axios` globally to any components in the VueJS, you can follow these steps:

In `main.js` you can just assign Axios to `$http`.

__main.js__
```js
import Axios from 'axios'

Vue.prototype.$http = Axios;

```

By modifying the vue prototype, any vue instance will have the ability to call `$http` on this.

For example-
```
this.$http.get('http://laravel-school.com/get')
```

Take a note that, the `$http` is the axios object now, so any method you can call on axios object, you can call on `this.$http`.

Thanks.
