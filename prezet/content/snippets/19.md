If you suddenly face PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of bytes exhausted (tried to allocate bytes) in Lumen or Laravel, there are few ways to solve this issue.

Most common ways to solve this issue by changing `php.ini` file. However, sometimes changing the value in `php.ini` file is troublesome.

## Alternative way.

The alternative way is just set the value `COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1` in the terminal.

Imagine that, you are trying to install `composer require ramsey/uuid` and facing the issue of allowed memory issue. In that case, just run the command this way-

```sh
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1
composer require ramsey/uuid
```

Now it should be working now.

Thanks.
