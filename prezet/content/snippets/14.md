Hi,

If you are planning to integrate Tiny WYSIWYG editor in your textarea, you might able to see this error __This domain is not registered with Tiny Cloud. Start a free trial to discover our premium cloud services and pro support.__.

Currently, I was facing this issue, then I figure out how to resolve this issue. What I have done is just use this CDN instead of the default one-

```
<script src="//cdn.tinymce.com/4/tinymce.min.js"></script>
```

That's it.

Hope it will work fine for you.

Thank you.
