excerpt: In this filamentphp snippet, I will show you how can you ignore unique() rule during editing existing entries.
---

In the [form builder](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/forms/validation#unique) of filamentphp, there is a rule called `unique()` which is basically confirm the creating / editing record should be unique. 

The problem is that, when you have existing record and you want to edit, you might get error because uniqueness will check in the database and get the same record exists. 

For example: 

```php
TextInput::make('email')
    ->required()
     ->unique(),
```

You will get **Email is already taken** validation error. 

### How to solve?

To solve this, you need to pass `ignorable` in the `unique()` method. 

```diff
  TextInput::make('email')
    ->required()
-   ->unique()
+   ->unique(ignorable: function($record) {
+        return $record;
+    }),
```

Now it should not validate the email uniqueness when editing an existing record. 

Thanks for reading.
