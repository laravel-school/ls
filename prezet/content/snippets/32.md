If you're using the Fish shell (`/usr/local/bin/fish`) on your Mac, you need to source the Fish configuration file to update the environment variables.

Follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to open the Fish configuration file in a text editor:
```sh
nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

If the `config.fish` file doesn't exist, it will be created.

2. In the `config.fish` file, add the following line to set the PHP version to 8.2:
```sh
set -x PATH /usr/local/opt/php@8.2/bin $PATH
```
This line adds the PHP 8.2 binary path to the beginning of the `PATH` variable.

Save the changes and exit the text editor.

3. Now, to apply the changes and update the environment variables, run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
This command sources the Fish configuration file, updating the environment variables.

4. To verify that the PHP version has been updated to 8.2, run the following command:
```sh
php -v
```

The output should display the PHP version as 8.2.x.
