If you are in a situation where you need to use Laravel `where()` and `orWhere()` condition together for one column, this tip might be helpful for you. Let's dig into a real life scenario.

Imagine that, I am checking `send_at` column. It can be both, either `null` or have `timestamp` value.

### What need to achieve?

- Get records if `send_at` is null.
- Get records also if `send_at` has value and then add a condition on that value. Probably time in certain time ago.

```php

Appointment::whereNull('send_at')
	->orWhere(function($query) {
	    $query->whereNotNull('send_at')
	    	->where('send_at', '<', now()->subMinutes(50)]);
	})->get()

```


This code will check-
- Whether `send_at` value is `null` or not.
- If it has value, then check whether the `send_at` value is less than 50 minutes ago from now or not.

Hope it will help you.

Thanks.
