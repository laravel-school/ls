If we have a new machine and need to set up the development environment, you might need a few hours to set up. However, I personally use a script that can help me to set up a new machine within an hour.

### Prerequisite

```sh
# Install homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install yadm
brew install yadm

# Clone this repo and run the bootstrap script
# on the first run you may want to say yes to things
yadm clone --bootstrap -f -b thouhedul https://github.com/tisuchi/dotfiles.git

```


It will take a few times to complete.

Thank you.
