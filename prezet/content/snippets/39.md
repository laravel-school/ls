excerpt: "In laravel, you have a config/foo.php config file like this. Today, I will show you how to use findOrFail for configuration in Laravel."
---

In laravel, you have a `config/foo.php` config file like this: 

```php
<?php

return [
    'foo' => env('FOO'),
];
```

## Scenario 1: 

If you somehow forget to set the value of `FOO` in the `.env` file for the production, your application may not act properly. 
In that case, since [Laravel 10](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/48261) you can use `Env::getOrFail('FOO')` in your configuration file. 

For example:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Env;

return [
    'foo' => Env::getOrFail('FOO')
];
```

**What are the benefits?**

This method is used to retrieve an environment variable and will throw a `RuntimeException` if the variable is not found, ensuring that your application fails early if a required environment variable is missing.


## Scenario 2: 

Alternatively you can define the default value in the configuration like this: 

```php
<?php

return [
    'foo' => env('FOO', 'SOME-DEFAULT-VALUE'),
];
```

**There is a problem though!**

In that case, you are exposing your default value to other developers or anyone has access in the code repository! 
So, **it's  suggested to use Scenario 1** which is much save with guard. 

Thanks.
