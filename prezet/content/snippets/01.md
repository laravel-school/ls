If you are facing any issue with Laravel Dusk testing related to `SessionNotCreatedException`, then there is a high chance to have this for not having an updated version of your browser.

Currently, I am using laravel dusk on google chrome, and I am having the following issue-

```
Facebook\WebDriver\Exception\SessionNotCreatedException: session not created
```

This is happening with me because I am using google chrome __76__ version where the latest is __77__.  Once I have updated the browser, it works fine for me.

Hope this tip will help you too.
