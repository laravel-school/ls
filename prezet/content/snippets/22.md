There are few ways to add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in header response in Laravel globally. However, I will show you the easiest way to add CORS that I have discovered recently.

Go to `bootstrap/app.php` file and add the following code-


```php
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: *');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *');
```

It should work now.

Thanks.
