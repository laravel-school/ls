So many developers are using [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as shell terminal for mac, including me. However, there is a helpful package called [z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z) which help you to jump quickly to directories that you have visited "frequently".
I am a big fan of it. Unfortunately it was not working with fish shell. 

However, after researching some time, I found an another [alternative package](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z) for fish shell which is maintained by [Jethrokuan](https://github.com/jethrokuan). 

> z is a port of z for the fish shell.

> z tracks the directories you visit. With a combination of frequency and recency, it enables you to jump to the directory in mind.

> A pure-fish port means z is fast and fish-friendly, with tab-completions and lazy-loading. Top that off with great customizability and a small amount of added functionality.
