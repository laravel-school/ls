Hey,

You may come across this post because of your `actingAs()` is not working with Laravel API Testing. I discovered the error of why it was happening with me also.

In my case, I use a custom guard called `jwt` that was not using laravel `actingAs()` by default. That's why I always get `401` error, probably you too.

To address this issue, you need to pass the custom guard name, in my case, it was `jwt`.

```js
$this->actingAs($user, 'jwt')->assetSuccess();
```

Hope it will work for you. :)
