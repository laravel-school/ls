If you want to handle Laravel Cors via middleware, here is the way to do that-

First create a file name `Cors.php`

```php
public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        if ($request->isMethod('OPTIONS')){
            $response = Response::make();
        } else {
            $response = $next($request);
        }
        return $response
            ->header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
            ->header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS')
            ->header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, X-Requested-With, Application');
    }
```

Then go to `http\Kernel.php` and added `Cors.php` file in the middleware route.

```php
protected $middleware = [
	\App\Http\Middleware\Cors::class, //add this line to $middleware variable
]
```

If you want to allow other headers to your routes, please add them in the 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' header field.
