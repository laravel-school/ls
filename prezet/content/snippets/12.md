Hi,

Most developers prefer to use __BootstrapVue__ in your application that is maintained by another community. Unfortunately, there are not many tutorials or tips on how to use Bootstrap core in Vue. Today, I will show you how to do that.

1. Go the __Vue Cli project__ run :
```
npm i bootstrap jquery popper.js
```

2. Go to `src/main.js` import like:
```
import 'bootstrap';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

That's it.

Of course, there are so many ways to achieve that. However, I feel this is the best one for easy integration.

Thank you.
