Laravel use __Carbon__ out of the box. If you are thinking about how to get the difference between two dates in laravel, here is the tip for you.

```php

$today = Carbon\Carbon::now();
$threeMonthsFromNow = Carbon\Carbon::now()->addMonths(3);

$totalDays = $today->diffInDays($threeMonthsFromNow);

```

Here, I just calculate `today` and 3 months later from today. The carbon will add 3 months automatically with today's date by line `Carbon\Carbon::now()->addMonths(3);`.


Hope it will work for you.
