If you want to get the method type in Laravel, I believe this would be one of the easiest way.

## In the Controller

```php
public function store(Request $request){
	if($request()->method() == "POST"){
		// Do your operation.
	}
}
```

## In the Blade

```
@if(request()->method() == 'POST')
	// Place your code
@endif

```

Thank you.
