If you often need to pass query string in laravel imagination, I believe passing query string globally will be the best choice instead of passing in every method. Here is how you can pass query string globally.

Go to `AppServiceProvider` and add the following code in `boot()` method.

```php
$this->app->resolving(LengthAwarePaginator::class, static function (LengthAwarePaginator $paginator) {
	return $paginator->appends(request()->query());
});

$this->app->resolving(Paginator::class, static function (Paginator $paginator) {
	return $paginator->appends(request()->query());
});
```

And of course, on top of your class, you need to import these files.

```php
use Illuminate\Pagination\Paginator;
use Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator;
```


Thanks.
