Imagine that I have a list of users. Some of them have verified email (`email_verified_at`) and some of them are not. Today I will show you the process to filter user by email verified and display in the tab.

## How to do that?

In your `ListUsers.php` page, add `getTabs()` method like this: 

```php
public function getTabs(): array
{
    return [
        'all' => Tab::make('All Users'),

        'verified' => Tab::make('Verified Users')
            ->modifyQueryUsing(function ($query) {
                $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at');
            }),

        'unverified' => Tab::make('Unverified Users')
            ->modifyQueryUsing(function ($query) {
                $query->whereNull('email_verified_at');
            }),
    ];
}
```

Now in your `/users/` url, you should see tabs that allows you to filter users. 

Thanks.
