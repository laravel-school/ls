# Software I use, gadgets I love, and other things I recommend.

I get asked a lot about the things I use to build software, stay productive, or buy to fool myself into thinking I'm being productive when I'm really just procrastinating. Here's a big list of all of my favorite stuff.

## Workstation

### [13" Macbook Pro, M1, 16GB RAM(2021)](https://www.apple.com/de/macbook-pro-13/)
I was using a 13" MacBook Pro prior to this and the difference is night and day. I've never heard the fans turn on a single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it through with our various launch simulations.

### [31.5" UHD 4K gaming monitor with USB Type-C](https://www.lg.com/de/monitore/gaming/32ul750p-w/)
The only display on the market if you want something HiDPI and bigger than 51.5". When you're working at planetary scale, every pixel you can get counts.

### [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/de/shop/product/MK2E3Z/A/magic-mouse-wei%C3%9Fe-multi-touch-oberfl%C3%A4che)
Something about all the gestures makes me feel like a wizard with special powers. I really like feeling like a wizard with special powers.

### [Sony WH 1000 XM3 Bluethooth Headphones](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/WH-1000XM3-Bluetooth-Canceling-headphones-Black/dp/B07GDR2LYK)
If you can snag the XM3 at a reasonable price, it is still considered a great headphone. If you wish to read about the latest models, check out our up-to-date list of the best noise cancelling headphones.

### [Air Pods Pro (2nd Generation)](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/WH-1000XM3-Bluetooth-Canceling-headphones-Black/dp/B07GDR2LYK)
AirPods Pro (2nd generation) continue to revolutionize personal audio by delivering incredible sound quality, up to double the Active Noise Cancellation of their predecessor, an advanced Transparency mode, a more immersive Spatial Audio experience, and an expanded range of ear tip sizes for an even better fit.

## Development Tools

### [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
I use VS code as a my primary code editor, however time to time, I love to use Sublime Text.

### [Kitty Terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
I love to use user friendly terminal so that I can interact most during the development. Therefore I prefer to use Kitty Terminal which is super friendly to me.

### [Table Plus](https://tableplus.com/)
Great software for working with databases. Has saved me from building about a thousand admin interfaces for my various projects over the years.

### [Ray Cast](https://www.raycast.com/)
If you want to make your search more productive, and efficient, then I hightly recommand to use Ray Cast which is super handly tool for Mac user.

### [Orb Stack](https://orbstack.dev/)
Docker is one of the essential tools for the development. However docker is heavy in most of the cases, as a result your machine might face difficulties to handle it.
Therefore I perfer to use Orb Stack which is alternative of docker. You can do almost same things that you can do with docker. NO extra changes are required!

## Productivity

### [Remarkable](https://remarkable.com/)
I love to take note everyday during my work, meeting and study. I prefer to put all of my notes in one place, so that I can able to access it easily without having any issue. I don't want to use I prefer to put all of my notes in one place, so that I can able to access it easily without having any issue.
I want something distruction free wrting as like as real paper instead of digital table. Therefore I highly recommand this.
