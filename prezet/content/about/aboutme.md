Hi, I am **Thouhedul Islam**.

I am a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) Developer with a passion for web development. I specialize in [PHP](https://php.net), particularly Laravel, as well as [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), and other cutting-edge web technologies.

During the day, I work for [GLEIF](https://www.gleif.org/), where I apply my skills and experience to develop innovative web applications. At night, I enjoy contributing to the community and solving problems. You can often find me on [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/@tisuchi), where I love to stay active and keep up-to-date with the latest trends in web development.

I am excited about the potential of technology and its power to transform people's lives.
