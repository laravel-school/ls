You will get an example in Laravel documentation that shows how to use `transform()` in Laravel. You might see example code like this:

```php
$collection = collect([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

$collection->transform(function ($item, $key) {
    return $item * 2;
});

$collection->all();

// [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Easy enough, right?

However, if it's not clear to you and you need a more in-depth real-life example, then let's see another example.

Imagine that you have a `users` collection that contains:

- id
- name
- email
- created_at
- updated_at

Now, during returning this data, you want to inject one or more records with each. For example, you want to inject a `location` column with each iteration.

The code will be like this:

```php
public function index()
{
    $users = User::latest()->get();

    /*
    // sample output
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@email.com",
        "created_at": "2018-12-13 19:34:44"
        "updated_at": "2018-12-13 19:34:44"
    },
    {...}
    */

    $users->transform(function ($transform) {
        $transform->location = "Kuala Lumpur";

        return $transform;
    });

    /*
    // transformed output
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@email.com",
        "location": "Kuala Lumpur",
        "created_at": "2018-12-13 19:34:44"
        "updated_at": "2018-12-13 19:34:44"
    },
    {...}
    */
}
```

Hope, it makes a clearer image to you.

Thank you.
