Hello

Today, I will show you how to install laravel livewire. Before that, if you are not familiar with Livewire,  here is about what exactly the laravel livewire.

> Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that makes building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.

Besides, you can check it out in the [official site](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and feel free to share your thought to the [official forum](https://forum.laravel-livewire.com/).

Let's get started.

## Table of Contents

## What's required
- A [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) Project
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## How to Install.

To install livewire to Laravel project, you need to run the following command in the terminal.

```
composer require livewire/livewire
```

Once you install livewire successfully, then you need to include livewire to your file.


## Setting Up
I assume that you have a fresh laravel project where you have installed livewire.

Now, go to __resources/views/welcome.blade.php__ file and follow the instructions-

- Add `@livewireStyles` inside your `<head>` tag
- Add `@livewireScripts` directive before close your `</body` tag.

Done, easy enough, right?
