In PHP, there is a built-in function called **[array_sum()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-sum.php)**. Normally **array_sum()** help to sum all the elements in an array. Today, I will show you the purpose of `array_sum()` and a practical uses of it.

Consider the following code, that helps you to sum all the elements of an array.
```php
<?php

$arrayValues = [2,5,3];

$result = 0;

foreach($arrayValues as $value){
	$result += $value;
}

echo $result;
```

The above code normally slices all the element of the array and then sum-up the value. This code should return 10.

The code works fine, but I am not happy to write a few lines of code to sum-up elements of an array only. Don't you think it's expensive?

Well, here what I come up with `array_sum()`.

```php
<?php

$arrayValues = [2,5,3];

echo array_sum($arrayValues);
```
Normally both of them work same and we get the same output. Don't you think `array_sum()` is better in this case?
