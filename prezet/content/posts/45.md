[Cloud Ways](https://cloudways.com) is being popular nowadays for small and medium-size hosting. [LS](http://laravel-school.com) is hosted into the Cloud Ways also. Recently I want to set-up a sub-domain for laravel-school.com for some particular purpose. It might be tricky for you, those don't know how to do that. Today, I will show you how to set up a sub-domain in CloudWays.

## What you need?
- Own of a domain
- Hosting in a CloudWays


### Domain
I own a domain that registered with NameCheap. Then I used [Cloud Flare](https://cloudflare.com) for CND of my website. So, technically DNS and A records are set up in the Cloud Flare.

First, go to the cloud flare and login to your account.

Then select your domain.

Next, click on the __DNS__ from the top menu

Then, finally, add _a_ record as you want. For example, I want to sub-domain is like __dev.laravel-school.com__.

So far we have done in the cloud flare. The next things are to set up in the cloudways. Let's do that.


### Hosting
Now, you need to login into your cloud ways account.

Once login, redirect to your __application__.

Click on __Add Application__ button on right side top corner.

Once you click there, you will see a pop-up for creating a new application. Then choose a server from there.

Once you choose a server, you will see another box for choosing what kinds of the application you are going to install. For me, I am going to install __laravel__. Then put your application name. You can put anything. Then finally click on __add application__ button.

It may take a few minutes. Once it's done, you just head into your application and then click on __domain management__ from the left sidebar. Now set your primary domain. Please make sure you provide the same domain that you have added for your __A__ record in cloudflare. For me, it's dev.laravel-school.com.

All you have done. It might take up to a few hours for propagating (Not applicable in all the time).

Hope it will be helpful for you.

Thank you.
