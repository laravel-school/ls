Hello

If you are having issue of Laravel migrate failed to open stream: No such file or directory, then this post might be helpful for you. Currently, I have the same issue.  Let me tell you how did I fix this issue.


Firstly I have run `dump-update`.

```sh
Compose dumpautoload
```

or

```sh
composer dump-autoload
```

Now you should able to run the `migration` command-
```sh
php artisan make:migration create_users_table
```

If you are still having the same issue, maybe you can try with
```sh
php artisan cache:clear
```

Because sometimes it happened because of cache issue.

Thank you.
