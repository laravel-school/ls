For some reason, if you change the model directory in laravel 8, you may face issues with creating the factory. It will show you the following error-

```php
Class 'Database\Factories\Your\Directory\Models\ModelFactory' not found
```

It's because of the way [laravel 8](https://github.com/nWidart/laravel-modules/issues/1094) changes the factory.

## Solution

Now in your, every model (that has factory) need to define a new method like that way-

```php

protected static function newFactory()
    {
        return \Your\Directory\Database\Factories\ModelFactory::new();
    }
```

If you think your database factories will be in `\Your\Directory` permanently, I suggest you can change in the `composer.json` file-

```json
"autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "app/",
            "Database\\Factories\\": "your/directory/factories/",
            "Database\\Seeders\\": "database/seeders/",
            "Gleif\\Otrs\\": "otrs/"
        }
    },
```
Now run-

```sh
composer dumpautoload
```

Then on the model side, simply add-
```php

protected static function newFactory()
    {
        return \Database\Factories\ModelFactory::new();
    }
```

Hope it will help you.
