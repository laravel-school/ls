Sometimes you need to write some query in laravel by using [Query Builder](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/queries), at the same time you might need to use [Eager loading](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent-relationships#eager-loading) the relationship. But unfortunately, eager loading and query builder does not fit together. So, in this scenario, how to do that? Today, I will show you a trick that might help you to depends on query builder less where you can easily implement eager loading.

## Table of Contents

## Scenario
Imagine I have a table called `events` where I need to fetch `ccFullAddress` column then group by `ccFullAddress` where I need to count all the `ccFullAddress` as `total` and finally __order by__ `total` desc. At the same time, in the view side, I will show the country name from the `countries` table based on `ccFullAddress` data.

There are a few options to make it succeed. Maybe I can use __query builder__ and create a global helper function to get the country name by passing a parameter in this function. Here we have come out with a solution.

```php
return DB::table('events')
            ->select('ccFullAddress', DB::raw('count(ccFullAddress) as total'))
            ->groupBy('ccFullAddress')
            ->orderBy('total', 'desc')
            ->get();
```

In the view side-

```html
<a href="" target="_blank">
	{{ getCountryNameById($event->ccFullAddress)->countryname }}
</a>
```

The above code will solve our issue however, it will create __N+1__ issue.

Alternatively, we can use __eager loading__ that load on __eloquent__. But we cannot use that since we need to `count` that.

So, how to solve this issue? Well, I tried to merge both together and come out with this solution-

```php
Event::with('country')
            ->select('ccFullAddress', DB::raw('count(ccFullAddress) as total'))
            ->groupBy('ccFullAddress')
            ->orderBy('total', 'desc')
            ->get();
```

Here I use eloquent then I try to use `DB` facade on that. In the view part, I try this way-
```html
<a href="">{{ $event->country->countryname }}</a>
```

And of course, I set a relationship between __countries__ and __events__ tables. So, we can easily fetch data from the __country__ table.

Hope it will help you.
