For some reason, if you need to install RabbitMQ on Mac, then this post will help you.

## Table of Contents

## Install RabbitMQ
I will use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing rabbitMQ. If you don't have homebrew installed yet, it's recommended to install it.

Now simply run in your terminal-

```sh
brew install rabbitmq
```

It will take some time for installing rabbitmq on your machine.

## Run RabbitMQ
There are two ways to run rabbitMQ.
- Command Line
- In Background

### Command line
To run in the command line, open the terminal and hit `~` then enter, that will bring you the root directory. Now run-
```
/usr/local/sbin/rabbitmq-server
```

If everything goes smoothly, it will show you-

```
.
.
.
Starting broker... completed with 6 plugins.
```

### Run from background
If you wish to run rabbitMQ in the background, then you need to run the following command-

```
brew services start rabbitmq
```

## How to access?
To access rabbitMQ, open your browser and access

http://localhost:15672

It will show you a login screen. Now provide the default credentials-

Username: **guest**
Password: **guest**

Thank you.
