If you are using MacBook and you want to update your current PHP version, it might be troublesome for you in some cases. There are [many ways](http://laravel-school.com/posts/how-to-upgrade-php-version-on-mac-29) to update php version in mac, however, today I will show you how to update PHP version globally.

Currently, I am using PHP 7.1 version on my machine. If you are using 5x, don't worry, it gonna be working for you too.

## Install PHP
I am using brew to install PHP. Run the following command in your terminal-
```sh
brew install php@7.3
```

**Sidenote**: Just keep in your mind, you can change PHP version whatever you need. For example, **php@7.3**  or **php@7.2**.

## Set required PHP to your PATH
Once you have installed PHP successfully, now you need to set the required PHP to your PATH. Run the following commands.

```sh
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@7.3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@7.3/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

It there is no issues, now is the time to check PHP version. To check the PHP version, run any of the following commands.

```sh
php -v
php --version
```

Hopefully, you will get your desired PHP version.

Thank you.
