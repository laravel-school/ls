Let's imagine that you have developed an app with [laravel](https://laravel.com), and then upload or deploy the app on shared hosting ([cPanel](https://cpanel.net/)). Unfortunately it's not straight forward because of different directory structure of laravel and cPanel.

In this post, I will show you the step by step process how to upload or deploy a laravel project on cPanel.

## Table of Content

## Step 1: Create a zip of your laravel app
Compress (zip) your Laravel project folder.

## Step 2: Upload the zipped project to cPanel
- Login into your cPanel
- Click on **File Manager**
- Go inside the `public_html`
- Click on **Upload**
- In the pop-up, then choose the zipped project (which you did in step 1)

## Step 3: Extract your zipped project
After uploading the zipped project, unzip it (in `public_html`).

## Step 4: Update `index.php` file
- Edit your `index.php` file from:

```php
require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/autoload.php';
$app = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';
```

TO:
```php
require __DIR__.'/bootstrap/autoload.php';
$app = require_once __DIR__.'/bootstrap/app.php';
```

## Step 5: Import Database
Two steps you need to follow:

### Create a database and user:
- Go to Cpanel and click **Database wizard**
- Create a new database
- Create a new user
- Associate newly created user with newly created database

### Import SQL file:
- Export your local database as an SQL file
- Go to **PHPMyAdmin** in cPanel
- Open the created database
- Click on the **import** option and import SQL file

## Step 6: Update database details

Go to `public_html/.env` file and update following section:

```sh
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE= # your database name
DB_USERNAME= # your database user name
DB_PASSWORD= # password for your database
```

## Step 7: (optional) Clearing cache

```bash
php artisan route:cache
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:cache
php artisan view:clear
php artisan optimize
```

Now if you visit your site e.g. http://example.com it should render your app properly.
