Although there is a lot of controversy surrounding testing in development, I prefer to follow testing practices. Testing a Laravel application has advantages over not testing it. In this post, I will guide you on how to create a new feature test in Laravel.

By default, Laravel provides two types of testing: unit testing and feature testing. Today, I will focus on creating a new feature test in Laravel.

To create a new feature test, you can use the `php artisan` command:

```bash
php artisan make:test TheNameOfYourTestFile
```

The above command will create a test file called `TheNameOfYourTestFile` in the `Feature` directory inside the `tests` folder. The file will have the following structure:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Tests\TestCase;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithFaker;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class TheNameOfYourTestFile extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic test example.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function testExample()
    {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

Now, you can define your test function. There is a default method inside the class called `testExample` that you can overwrite. Let's do that-

```php

/**
 * A basic test example.
 *
 * @return void
 */
public function testAVisitorCanSignUp()
{
    $this->assertTrue(true);
}
```

After saving the file, now let's run testing. To run, you need to open the terminal and redirect to the project directory and then use the following command.

```bash
phpunit
```

You might be encountered an error that **phpunit command not found: phpunit**. So, you need to show where is php unit is located. Let do it once again-

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

It should show you the error or success message.

Cool. You have run your first PHP Test. Let's dig into the next location.
