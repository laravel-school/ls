For interactive laravel application, we need task schedular. Writing task schedular is [very easy](https://laravel.com/docs/scheduling) by the magic of laravel. 
However writing test for schedular is not that straight-forward.
In this post, I will show you how can you easily test your schedular. 

**What you need?**
- A laravel application

## Scenario

Imagine that in my app, I have a job called `SendEmailReminderJob` that run in every minute. 


## Create Job

To create the job, you need to run the following command: 

```sh
php artisan make:job SendEmailReminderJob
```

You will get a job like this: 
```php

namespace App\Jobs;

// Some imports... 

class SendEmailReminderJob implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

    /**
     * Execute the job.
     */
    public function handle(): void
    {
        // Write your logic here üôÇ
    }
}
```

## Schedule the Job

To schedule the job, you need to go to `App\Console\Kernel.php` file and add the following line in the `schedule()` method. 

```php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->job(new SendEmailReminderJob )->everyMinute();
}
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è [Check more](https://laravel.com/docs/scheduling#schedule-frequency-options) how schedular works.

If your system configure queue properly, the `SendEmailReminderJob` job will run in every minutes. 

## Write Test

I will create a test class for writing the test. 

```sh
php artisan make:test SchedularTest
```

In the `SchedularTest` class, 

```php

<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Tests\TestCase;
use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Event;
use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule;
use App\Jobs\SendEmailReminderJob;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class SchedularTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    /** @test */
    public function it_schedule_send_email_reminder_job_in_every_minute()
    {
        // Arrange + Act
        $jobClass = SendEmailReminderJob::class;

        // Fetches Laravel's scheduler instance 
        $schedule = app()->make(Schedule::class);

        // Only keep the events that match the $jobClass in their description field. 
        $event = collect($schedule->events())->filter(function (Event $event) use ($jobClass) {
            return $event->description === $jobClass;
        })->first();

        // Assert
        // Assertion ensures that the event passes all registered filters
        $this->assertTrue($event->filtersPass($this->app));

        // Confirm the expression which run in every second
        $this->assertEquals("* * * * *", $event->expression);
    }
}
```

## Run the test

Now run the test, and hope everything will pass for you. 

```sh
php artisan test
```

Thanks for reading üôÇ.
