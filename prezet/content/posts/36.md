Hello

If you are suddenly facing the issue on Laravel testing that, **PHP Fatal error: Declaration of Tests\TestCase::setUp() must be compatible with Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase::setUp():....** in that case, this post might be helpful for you.

Normally it happened because of PHP Unit 8 incompatibility issue. If you suddenly upgrade your Laravel version, you might have a high chance to face this issue.

## How to solve?

To solve this issue, you need to go to `tests/Feature/UserTest.php` file and make this change.

```php
class UserTest extends TestCase
{
        public function setUp(): void
   	{
                parent::setUp();

```

Here, I just add `: void` after the `setUp()` method name.

Hope it will work for you.
