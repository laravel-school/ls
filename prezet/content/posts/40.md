No doubt that github become one of the essential parts of the developers nowadays. Modern developers fully depend on git-flow to produce a better result. But sometimes searching on github repo is not smoothly. Today I will show you __how to find any file in github repo easily__.

Firstly, go to the repo where you are looking for the file. For example, in my case, it will be [laravel-school/introduction-laravel-policy](https://github.com/laravel-school/introduction-laravel-policy) . Now, I just simply type __`t`__ on my keyboard and then it will show me the searching option in my repo. Now I can easily search by class name. It is real-time search.

Thank you.
