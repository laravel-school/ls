Hey Buddy.

I found **9 Rules** for writing comments on code.

**Rule 1: Comments should not duplicate the code.**

**Rule 2: Good comments do not excuse unclear code.**

**Rule 3: If you canâ€™t write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.**

**Rule 4: Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.**

**Rule 5: Explain unidiomatic code in comments.**

**Rule 6: Provide links to the original source of copied code.**

**Rule 7: Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.**

**Rule 8: Add comments when fixing bugs.**

**Rule 9: Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.**
