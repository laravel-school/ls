Laravel request is the way to fetch user's form data. By default, whatever you have written in the form, you are able to receive the data via Laravel Request.

The normal procedure is-

```php
function storeDate(Request $request)
{
	return $request->all();
}
```

This method will receive all the submitted field data from the web form.

Now, if you need to add extra data into `request` array, you can add this way.

```php
function storeDate(Request $request)
{
	$authorName = 'Put your value here';

	$myNewData = $request->request->add(['author' => $authorName]);

	return $request->all();
}
```


Now you are able to access `$authorName` in the `request` array.

If you have more than one value you want to add, you can pass another value into the array like this way-

```php
$myNewData = $request->request->add([
		'author' => $authorName
		'author2' => $authorName2
	]);
```


Hope it will be helpful for you.  Thank you.
