Hey,

If you are facing any issue related with Mixed Content of your laravel project, here could one of the possible solution that recently I faced.

In my case, the entire stylesheet was broken and I got the following errors in the console-

**Mixed content: load all resources via HTTPS to improve the security of your site.**

### Table of Contents

### Why it happened?

I was using `asset()` for declaring styles and scripts. The actual reason is the `asset()` won't handle https automatically. That's why it was happening.


### How did I solve it?
In my `.env` file, I set the following lines-

```

APP_URL=https://myproject.test
ASSET_URL="${APP_URL}"

```

Here, I mainly added `ASSET_URL` that actually took the `APP_URL` data, that is following the `https`.\\

Hope it will work for you also.

Thanks.
