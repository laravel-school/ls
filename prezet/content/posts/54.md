In the local development, we see the Laravel error page a lot. Most probably the countless time in every day. You can do a beautiful representation of the error page, the will be more readable, eye-catching and nice to see. [Ignition](https://github.com/facade/ignition) brings a beautiful error page of your application. Let's see how we can integrate into our project.

## Table of Contents

## Installation of Ignition
The package is included in laravel `6.xx` version already. However, if you use lower version than that, you need to pull via composer.

```sh
composer require --dev facade/ignition
```

Now, if you use Laravel `5.5`, `5.6` and `5.7` then you need to modify your `app/Exceptions/Handler.php` file to load Ignition instead of the default Whoops page.

You need to add this method to your `Handler.php` file:
```php
protected function whoopsHandler()
{
    try {
        return app(\Whoops\Handler\HandlerInterface::class);
    } catch (\Illuminate\Contracts\Container\BindingResolutionException $e) {
        return (new \Illuminate\Foundation\Exceptions\WhoopsHandler)->forDebug();
    }
}
```

Finally, publish your configurable file.
```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Facade\Ignition\IgnitionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

Basically it will publish the following files:
`config/ignition.php` and `config/flare.php`.

Now you are ready to check. Boot up your laravel server and make a mistake, then the error page should return something like this.

Cool, right?

Besides, you can send this exception error to [flare app](https://flareapp.io). If you want to know more how to set up, [check here](https://flareapp.io/docs/ignition-for-laravel/installation#sending-errors-to-flare).

Let's dig into ignition package what else we can do?

### Configuration

There is a configuration section, where we can set most popular editors, i.g. `phpstorm`, `vscode`, `sublime` and `atom`. Besides, we can set a theme. By default, the `light` theme is already set out of the box.

### Identifying user data

If you pass your error data into [flare app](https://flareapp.io), it will pass the authenticated user's data once the exception occurs. You can customize error details here-

```php
class User extends Model {
    //

   public function toFlare(): array {
      // Only `id` will be sent sent to Flare.
      return [
         'id' => $this->id
      ];
   }
}
```

Besides all the facilities, it supports some other features out of the box. Hope you will like this package.
