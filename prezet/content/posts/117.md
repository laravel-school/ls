Upgrading **[Open Journal Systems (OJS)](https://openjournalsystems.com/)** on **cPanel** isn't as straightforward as one might hope. Even for a minor or patch-level update, multiple steps need careful execution.  

Surprisingly, I couldnâ€™t find a well-documented guide covering the complete upgrade process. Not pointing fingersâ€”perhaps the community is more focused on development rather than documentation!  

I manage two OJS-based journal websites, and recently, I faced quite a challenge upgrading OJS on **cPanel**. After navigating through the hurdles, I decided to document my experience to help others in the same boat.  

# **Upgrading OJS: From 3.3.0.8 to 3.4.0.8**  

- **Current Version:** [`3.3.0.8`](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/releases/tag/3_3_0-8)  
- **Target Version:** [`3.4.0.8`](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/releases/tag/3_4_0-8)  


## **My Hosting Environment**  

Iâ€™m using a **shared cPanel hosting** from **[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/shared/)**. While shared hosting is convenient, it also comes with some limitations, making upgrades more complex.  

# **Step-by-Step OJS Upgrade Guide**  

Upgrading **OJS on cPanel** requires **careful preparation** to avoid downtime or data loss. Follow this structured approach:  

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Backup Everything (Non-Negotiable!)**  

Before making any changes, create a **full backup** of your OJS files and database.  

### **ðŸ“Œ Backup OJS Files**  
1. Log in to **cPanel**.  
2. Open **File Manager** and locate your OJS directory (`public_html/ojs/` or similar).  
3. Select all files and **Compress â†’ ZIP**.  
4. Download the ZIP file for safekeeping.  

### **ðŸ“Œ Backup OJS Database**  
1. In **cPanel**, navigate to **phpMyAdmin**.  
2. Select your OJS database.  
3. Click **Export â†’ Quick Export â†’ Go**.  
4. Save the `.sql` file locally.  

ðŸ”¹ **Pro Tip:** If anything goes wrong, these backups will save your day!  

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Download the Latest OJS Version**  

- Visit the **official OJS download page**:  
  ðŸ”— [https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/download/](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/download/)  
- Download the **latest stable OJS ZIP file**.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Enable Maintenance Mode**  

Before making changes, enable **maintenance mode** to prevent users from accessing the site.  

- **How?** Follow this guide:  
  [How to Enable Maintenance Mode in OJS](https://openjournaltheme.com/docs/how-to-add-maintenance-mode-on-ojs/)  

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Upload & Replace Old Files**  

1. Open **cPanel â†’ File Manager**.  
2. Navigate to `public_html/ojs/`.  
3. **Delete the following folders** (but **keep** `config.inc.php` and `public`):  
   ```
   cache
   lib
   locale
   plugins
   templates
   classes
   controllers
   pages
   ```
4. Upload the **new OJS ZIP file**.  
5. Extract the ZIP **inside the same directory**.  
6. **Restore your old `config.inc.php`** from backup.  
7. Make sure the **`public` folder remains untouched**, as it contains uploaded journal files.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Run the OJS Upgrade Script**  

1. Open **cPanel â†’ Terminal** (or use SSH if available).  
2. Navigate to your OJS directory:  
   ```bash
   cd public_html/ojs
   ```
3. Run the upgrade command:  
   ```bash
   php tools/upgrade.php upgrade
   ```
   - If successful, youâ€™ll see **"Upgrade Complete"**.  
   - If errors appear, check the **error_log** in cPanel.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Verify the Upgrade**  

1. Log in to your **OJS Admin Panel**.  
2. Go to **Administration â†’ System Information** to check the version.  
3. Open a few journal pages to ensure everything is working.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Disable Maintenance Mode**  

- Follow [**Step 3**](#-step-3-enable-maintenance-mode) in reverse to re-enable public access.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Clear Cache (Final Step!)**  

1. Log in as an administrator.  
2. Go to **Administration â†’ Clear Data Caches**.  
3. Click **Clear Template Cache** and **Clear Data Cache**.  

# **ðŸ’¡ Plan B: What If Something Goes Wrong?**  

If the upgrade doesnâ€™t work, donâ€™t panic! **Roll back to your backup.**  

### **How to Restore Your Old OJS Version?**  

1. **Delete everything in your OJS directory** (except `public/`).  
2. Extract your **old backup ZIP**.  
3. Restore your **old database** via phpMyAdmin.  
4. Your site should be back to its previous state.  

ðŸš€ **Thatâ€™s it! Your OJS is upgraded successfully.**  

# **Final Thoughts**  

ðŸ”¹ Upgrading OJS on **cPanel shared hosting** can be tricky, but with proper backups and step-by-step execution, it's manageable.
