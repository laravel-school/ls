In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Laravel Subquery in real life example. I have inspired to write about this article by reading [Jonathan Reinink](https://twitter.com/reinink) [post](https://reinink.ca/articles/dynamic-relationships-in-laravel-using-subqueries). A big clap for him.

Imagine that, you have two tables, `users` and `posts` where **users** table `hasMany()` relationship with **posts** table. Now, we would love to show all users paginate by 10 and show their last post time. In this example, we will try to overcome the following challenges-
* Minimizing database queries
* Minimizing memory usage

The first idea comes in mind that, we can easily use **relationship** with **eager loading**. No doubt, yes, we can do that. Let's do.

```php
$users = User::with('events')->paginate(10);

return view('home', compact('users'));
```

Sure enough, it will show the data in the view.

Cool. But if you notice that, it has solved the  [**N+1**](https://www.sitepoint.com/silver-bullet-n1-problem/ "**N+1**") issue, however, the memory size has been increased. For example-

- Users per page 				=> **50** users
- Average Posts per user 		=> **250** Posts
- Total Posts records loaded 	=> **12,500** records

So, it doesn't serve our purpose. So, let's dig into the other way, called Laravel Subqueries.


## Subqueries
Basically, Laravel subqueries allow selecting extra columns or attributes in the primary table query.

```php
$lastPost = Post::select('created_at')
    ->whereColumn('user_id', 'users.id')
    ->latest()
    ->limit(1)
    ->getQuery();

$users = User::select('users.*')
    ->selectSub($lastPost, 'last_post_at')
    ->get();

@foreach ($users as $user)
    <tr>
        <td>{{ $user->name }}</td>
        <td>{{ $user->email }}</td>
        <td>
            @if ($user->last_post_at)
                {{ $user->last_post_at->format('M j, Y \a\t g:i a') }}
            @else
                No post yet
            @endif
        </td>
    </tr>
@endforeach

{{ $users->paginate(10) }}
```

If we deep look into this query, we will get this-

```sql
select
    "users".*,
    (
        select "created_at" from "posts"
        where "user_id" = "users"."id"
        order by "created_at" desc
        limit 1
    ) as "last_post_at"
from "users"
```

This will get the required information for users page by a single query. No doubt, increase the performance drastically where it keeps both the N+1 and the minimizing the memory usage. Cool, right?


## Using subquery in query scope
It is also possible to use a subquery in the Laravel query scope. Let's convert subquery into a scope on the User model-

```php
class User extends Model
{
    public function scopeWithLastPostDate($query)
    {
        $query->addSubSelect('last_post_at', Post::select('created_at')
            ->whereColumn('user_id', 'users.id')
            ->latest()
        );
    }
}

$users = User::withLastPostDate()->get();
```

Nice, right?


## Using Macro in query scope
There is a way to set a **macro** to keep the subquery boilerplate that will reduce your effort too. A new addSubSelect method will be added to the query builder. Add the following code in your `AppServiceProvider`.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

Builder::macro('addSubSelect', function ($column, $query) {
    if (is_null($this->columns)) {
        $this->select($this->from.'.*');
    }

    return $this->selectSub($query->limit(1), $column);
});
```

This macro basically do-
* Add a `select('table.*')` to get the base table columns and the new subquery column. It is required, while the Laravel won't include a `select *`.
* Add the limit of one because of subqueries can able to return a single row only.
* Call the `selectSub` method.

Finally, let's write the code to use this new macro:

```php
$users = User::addSubSelect('last_post_at', Post::select('created_at')
    ->whereColumn('user_id', 'users.id')
    ->latest()
)->get();
```

Cool.

So, let's stop here. If you have any query/opinion/suggestion, let's discuss to improve that.

Thank you.
