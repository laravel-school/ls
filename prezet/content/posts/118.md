Integrating powerful event sourcing in Laravel has never been easier, thanks to the [Verbs package](https://verbs.thunk.dev). If you're building admin panels or internal tools with [FilamentPHP](https://filamentphp.com), combining it with Verbs opens up an elegant way to manage application state using event-driven logic.

In this article, I’ll walk you through building a simple **Todo application** using FilamentPHP and the Verbs package, based on the open-source repository: [github.com/tisuchi/filament-with-verbs](https://github.com/tisuchi/filament-with-verbs).


## 🚀 Why Use Verbs with Filament?

- **Event Sourcing**: Every change to your model is recorded as an event.
- **Auditability**: You can replay or inspect changes to debug issues.
- **Elegant state management**: Your domain logic lives inside well-structured `Event` and `State` classes.


## 🧱 Installation

Start by creating a fresh Laravel project:

```bash
laravel new filament-verbs-app
cd filament-verbs-app
```

Install required packages:

```bash
composer require filament/filament
composer require thunk/verbs
```

Publish Verbs migrations and config:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=verbs-migrations
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=verbs-config
php artisan migrate
```

Install Filament:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-user
```

## 🧠 Creating the Todo Domain

We'll define a `TodoState` that represents our aggregate's current status.

### 1. Create the State Class

```bash
php artisan make:state Todo
```

In `app/States/TodoState.php`:

```php
namespace App\States;

use Thunk\Verbs\State;

class TodoState extends State
{
    public int $todoId;

    public string $title;

    public ?string $description;

    public bool $isCompleted;

    public int $userId;
}
```

### 2. Define Events

#### TodoCreated Event:

```php
php artisan make:event TodoCreated
```

```php
namespace App\Events;

use App\Models\Todo;
use Thunk\Verbs\Event;
use App\States\TodoState;
use Thunk\Verbs\Attributes\Autodiscovery\StateId;

class TodoCreated extends Event
{
    #[StateId(TodoState::class)]
    public int $todoId;

    public string $title;

    public ?string $description;

    public bool $isCompleted;

    public int $userId;

    public function apply(TodoState $state)
    {
        $state->title = $this->title;
        $state->description = $this->description;
        $state->isCompleted = $this->isCompleted;
        $state->userId = $this->userId;
    }

    public function handle(TodoState $state)
    {
        return Todo::create([
            'id' => $this->todoId,
            'title' => $state->title,
            'description' => $state->description,
            'is_completed' => $state->isCompleted,
            'user_id' => $state->userId,
        ]);
    }
}
```

#### TodoUpdated Event:

```php
namespace App\Events;

use App\Models\Todo;
use Thunk\Verbs\Event;
use App\States\TodoState;
use Thunk\Verbs\Attributes\Autodiscovery\StateId;

class TodoUpdated extends Event
{
    #[StateId(TodoState::class)]
    public int $todoId;

    public ?string $title;

    public ?string $description;

    public bool $isCompleted;

    public function apply(TodoState $state)
    {
        $state->title = $this->title;
        $state->description = $this->description;
        $state->isCompleted = $this->isCompleted;
    }

    public function handle(TodoState $state)
    {
        return Todo::findOrFail($this->todoId)->update([
            'title' => $state->title,
            'description' => $state->description,
            'is_completed' => $state->isCompleted,
        ]);
    }
}
```

## 🎨 Creating the Filament Resource

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Todo
```

In `TodoResource.php`, override the create and update logic:

```php
class TodoResource extends Resource
{
    protected static ?string $model = Todo::class;

    public static function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                // Check details implementation there: https://github.com/tisuchi/filament-with-verbs/blob/main/app/Filament/Resources/TodoResource.php
            ]);
    }

    public static function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->columns([
                // Check details implementation there: https://github.com/tisuchi/filament-with-verbs/blob/main/app/Filament/Resources/TodoResource.php
            ]);
    }
}
```

### Update `CreateTodo` page

```diff
namespace App\Filament\Resources\TodoResource\Pages;

+ use App\Events\TodoCreated;

class CreateTodo extends CreateRecord
{

+    // Override the create method to use events instead
+    protected function handleRecordCreation(array $data): Model
+    {
+        // Fire the TodoCreated event instead of creating the record through Filament
+        TodoCreated::commit(
+            todoId: snowflake_id(),
+            title: $data['title'],
+            description: $data['description'],
+            isCompleted: $data['is_completed'],
+            userId: Auth::id(),
+        );
+
+        // Find the most recently created Todo for the current user
+        // This is necessary because Filament expects a model to be returned
+        return \App\Models\Todo::where('user_id', Auth::id())
+            ->latest()
+            ->first();
+    }
}
```

### Update `CreateTodo` page

```diff
namespace App\Filament\Resources\TodoResource\Pages;

+ use App\Events\TodoUpdated;

class EditTodo extends EditRecord
{
+    protected function mutateFormDataBeforeSave(array $data): array
+    {
+        TodoUpdated::commit(
+            todoId: $this->record->id,
+            title: $data['title'],
+            description: $data['description'] ?? null,
+            isCompleted: $data['is_completed'] ?? false,
+        );
+
+        return \App\Models\Todo::where('user_id', Auth::id())
+            ->latest()
+            ->first()
+            ->toArray();
+    }
}
```

## 🔁 Replaying Events

For some reason, you may need to replay and rebuild the data from your event and states. To do so, you need to truncate your `todos` table. 

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Please take a note that, you **must not** truncate 3 tables prefix with `verb_` tables. If you mess with this tables, you will come out with some unusual results. 

1. Before truncate the database, confirm that I have this record in the `todos` table. 

   <img src="https://github.com/tisuchi/filament-with-verbs/raw/main/docs/images/8-todos.png" width="600" alt="Reconstructed Todos Table">

1. First, clear the current state by truncating the `todos` table (this simulates data loss in the domain table)

1. Run the replay command to rebuild the state from events:
   ```bash
   php artisan verbs:replay
   ```

1. Confirm that you want to run all events:

   <img src="https://github.com/tisuchi/filament-with-verbs/raw/main/docs/images/9-verbs-replay.png" width="600" alt="Verbs Replay Confirmation">

1. Successful replay notification:

   <img src="https://github.com/tisuchi/filament-with-verbs/raw/main/docs/images/10-replay-success.png" width="600" alt="Replay Success">

1. Verify that the `todos` table has been fully reconstructed with exactly the same data that was there before:

   <img src="https://github.com/tisuchi/filament-with-verbs/raw/main/docs/images/8-todos.png" width="600" alt="Reconstructed Todos Table">

This demonstrates the power of event sourcing - even if you lose your entire domain table, you can rebuild it completely from the stored events!


This will apply all events from the `events` table and reconstruct your state objects.
