One of the nice things of Larave is [eager loading](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent-relationships#eager-loading). Now, sometimes if you need to check whether the model has loaded the eager loading or not, then you need to check with `relationLoaded()`. Here is how you check this-

Here is my original code.
```php
$users = App\User::with('profile')->first();
```

Now, I want to check whether `$user` load the relationship `profile` or not.

```php

$users = App\User::with('profile')->first();

if($users->relationLoaded('posts')){
	// yes, it has been loaded
	// now, place your logic here
}

```

The function `relationLoaded()` returns `true` if relationship has loaded with the object, otherwise return `false`.
