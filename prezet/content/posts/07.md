If you want to delete a file from public folder in Laravel, surely you can use PHP's `unlink()` method to remove that.

Besides `unlink()`, you can remove file by laravel way, by using the `File::delete()` method instead.

```php
// Delete a single file
File::delete($filename);

// Delete multiple files
File::delete($file1, $file2, $file3);

// Delete an array of files
$files = array($file1, $file2);
File::delete($files);
