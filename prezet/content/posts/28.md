excerpt: Apply The Open Closed Principle in Laravel | Part 1

I think one of the most popular design principles is **Open Closed Principle** that most of the PHP developers use in their project. I am going to show you how to use the Open Closed Principle in Laravel. In order to write deeply, this article might have a few sections. Today, I am going to show you the first part.

## Table of Contents

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), the definition of the Open-Closed Principle is-
> Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

Confused, right?

## What is exactly Open-closed principles?
In my word, it tells you that, a method is open to adding new logic in your code (Open for extension), but you can not modify the existing code for adding new logic (Closed for modification).

## Real-life Scenario
Imagine you have an admin panel, where you have to create [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) system for Posts, Users, Categories and so on. To solve this issue, normally we create separate controllers for each and do individual CRUD operation on that, right? For example-

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UsersController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
    	# code...
    }

    public function create()
    {
    	# code...
    }

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
    	# code...
    }

    public function show($id)
    {
    	# code...
    }

    public function edit(Request $request, $id)
    {
    	# code...
    }

    public function delete($id)
    {
    	# code...
    }
}
```

I am sure, many developers like me think this way. Actually nothing wrong with this concept.

But, I have a different opinion. This way might be ok if you write one CRUD controller/operation like users only. How about if you have more than one CRUD operation like users, posts, categories and so on?

In my opinion, of course, it's not a good practice to write your code this way if you have more than one CRUD implementation. To overcome this challenge, I suggest implementing Open-Closed Principles that allow us to write maintainable code. Let's draw the picture.

## What we need?
We are going to implement this structure in Laravel. I expect you to have a Laravel installation. Now, we need to adjust database connection with Laravel in `.env` file. Then migrate the database with-
```sh
php artisan migrate
```

Then add some record into the `users` table.

Now we need the following structure in your `App\` folder.
- *Interfaces/CrudInterface.php*
- *Controllers/UsersController.php*
- *Repositories/CrudRepository.php*
- *Repositories/UsersRespository.php*

## Let's start-
First of all, let's update the route in `web.php` file-
```php
<?php

Route::resource('users', 'UsersController');
```

Now let's create the *UsersController*-
```sh
php artisan make:controller UsersController
```

Now create a folder called **Interfaces** inside the **Http** folder and then add a file called `CrudInterface`. I have defined all the possible methods inside the interface. It should be like this-
```php
<?php namespace App\Http\Interfaces;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

interface CrudInterface{
	// Show list of the user
	public function index();

	// Show create form
	public function create();

    // Store a new record
    public function store(Request $request);

    // Show edit form
    public function edit($id);

    // Update an existing record.
    public function put(Request $request, $id);

    // Delete a record
    public function delete($id);
}
```

Now whoever wants to implement that, they need to follow this structure in their class. In our case, we want to implement `CrudInterface` in the  `UsersRepository`. Then let's create `UsersRepository` inside **Repositories** folder.
```php

<?php
namespace App\Http\Repositories;

use App\Http\Interfaces\CrudInterface;
use App\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class UsersRepository implements CrudInterface
{
    // Show list of the user
    public function index(){

    }

    // Show user create form
    public function create(){

    }

    // Store a new user record
    public function store(Request $request){

    }

    // Show User edit form
    public function edit($id){

    }

    // Update user's existing data.
    public function put(Request $request, $id){

    }

    // Delete a user
    public function delete($id){

    }
}
```

So far, the structure is clear enough, right? You will get the code in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/laravel-school/Laravel-Open-Closed-Principles).

Well, today I am going to stop here. I will continue the rest of the part in the next episode. If you have any confusion or query, let's discuss in the comment section.
