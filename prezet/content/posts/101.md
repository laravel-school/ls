The PHP `__call()` magic method is an incredibly powerful tool for dynamic method handling and custom object behaviors.
While its basic usage is well-known, there are many advanced techniques and real-life scenarios where the [`__call()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.overloading.php#object.call) method can be utilized to take your code to the next level.
In this article, we'll explore some of these advanced uses of the `__call()` method with real-life examples.

Imagine that you have class like this:

```php
class MyClass {
    private string $foo;
    private string $bar;
    // You have few more private properties

    public function __construct(string $foo, string $bar){
        $this->foo = $foo;
        $this->bar = $bar;
    }

    public function getFoo(){
        return $this->foo;
    }

    public function getBar(){
        return $this->bar;
    }

    // You have few more getter methods
}
```

Now you can access like this way:

```php
$object = new MyClass('Foo', 'Bar');

$object->foo();     // Foo
$object->bar();     // Bar
```

Definitely it will be a problem as long as your private properly increase that you want to access outside of the class.
Therefore the `__call()` magic method exists to access.

## How to use `__call()` magic method?

```php
class MyClass {
    private string $foo;
    private string $bar;
    // You have few more private properties

    public function __construct(string $foo, string $bar){
        $this->foo = $foo;
        $this->bar = $bar;
    }

    public function __call($methodName, $arguments) {
        if (! property_exists($this, $methodName)) {
            throw new Exception("Bad Method Name Exception: $methodName");
        }

        return $this->$methodName;
    }
}
```

Now you can call exactly the same way and you will get the same result.

```php
$object = new MyClass('Foo', 'Bar');

$object->foo();     // Foo
$object->bar();     // Bar
```

In this way, you can increase as many as private property you want.
All will works fine as long as you use the same name for method and property.

Thanks :)
