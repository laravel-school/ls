Tumblr is one of the famous microblogging and social networking website. If you are a fan of Tumblr and planning to use its [official API](https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.php). In this post, I mainly focus on how to integrate with Laravel.

## Table of Contents

## Install
First of all, you need to install the package with `composer`.
```sh
composer require tumblr/tumblr
```

Now run -

```sh
composer update
```

You have already installed the package. Now let's integrate.


## Integration
Just declare a new route-
```php
Route::get('/tumblr', 'TumblrController@index');
```

Now you need to have `api_key` and `secret_key` to connect. You need to register it in your [Tumblr Apps](https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/register).

Once you have it, then go to the [this link](https://api.tumblr.com/console/calls/user/info) and get `oauth_token` and `oauth_token_secret`.

You probably will get something like this-

```php
// Authenticate via OAuth
$client = new Tumblr\API\Client(
            'api_key',
            'secret_key',
            'oauth_token',
            'oauth_token_secret'
);

// Make the request
$client->getUserInfo();
```

Now copy that code and paste in the controller, that will be like this. In this example, I am creating a new post and publish it in Tumblr.

```php
public function create()
    {
        $client = new Tumblr\API\Client(
            'api_key',
            'secret_key',
            'oauth_token',
            'oauth_token_secret'
        );

        $blogName = 'name-of-your-blog';

        $data = [
            'title' => $title,
            'tags' => $tags,
            'thumbnail' => $thumbnail,
            'url' => $url,
            'type' => 'link'
        ];

        $client->createPost($blogName, $data);
    }
```

Now once you browse this `http://127.0.0.1:8000/tmblr`, you will have a new post in your Tumblr blog.

You will get the full list of Tumblr API  methods [here](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2).

Thank you. :)
