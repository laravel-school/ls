Hello

I found some good tips to write robust and maintainable software. After reading the post, here is the extraction of this article-

__Rule__ 1 — Don't use goto, rationalize the use of continuing and break, don't use the switch.

__Rule 2__ — Prove that your problem can never create runaway code.

__Rule 3__ — To do so, limit the size of it. Usually using pagination, map/reduce, chunking, etc.

__Rule 4__ — Make code that fits in your head. If it fits in a page, it fits in your head.

__Rule 5__ — Check that things are right. Fail when wrong. Monitor failures. See rule 7.

__Rule 6__ — Don't use global-ish variables. Store data in the smallest possible scope.

__Rule 7__ — Let exceptions bubble up until you properly recover and/or report them.

__Rule 8__ — If you use transpilers, make sure that they solve more problems than they bring

__Rule 9.1__ — Don't use references even if your language supports it

__Rule 9.2__ — Copy arguments instead of mutating them, unless it's the explicit purpose of the function

__Rule 9.3__ — Use as many type-safety features as you can

__Rule 10__ — Use several linters and tools to analyze your code. No warning shall be ignored.
