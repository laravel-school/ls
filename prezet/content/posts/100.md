As a developer, presenting ideas to your group, team members, or managers is a common occurrence. Using tools like **Google Slides** or **PowerPoint** can be inconvenient for developers as they require adding code, diagrams, flowcharts, and other technical elements. A developer-friendly approach is to write your presentation in [Markdown](https://laravel-school.com/posts/markdown-explained-benefits-uses-and-capabilities-97) and then convert it to slides, PDF, or another convenient format. In this article, we'll guide you through a step-by-step process to easily convert your Markdown document to a slideshow. Let's get started!

### What is Marp VS Code extension?

[Marp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) for VS Code is an extension for the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor that allows you to create and present slide decks using Markdown. It is based on the [Marp presentation tool](https://marp.app/), which uses the same Markdown syntax as other Marp tools, but integrates directly into the VS Code editor for a seamless and intuitive experience.

With the Marp for VS Code extension, you can create professional-looking slide decks using Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, images, and other formatting elements. You can also add slide-specific features such as slide backgrounds, slide transitions, and speaker notes. The Marp for VS Code extension also includes several slide templates that you can use to quickly create a professional-looking presentation.

## Installing Marp for VS Code

Installing Marp for VS Code is a simple process.

- Click on the **Extensions icon** on the left-hand side of the VS Code window.
- Search for **Marp** using the search box, and look for **Marp for VS Code** in the search results
- Click on the **Install button**.

Wait for the installation to complete. You may be prompted to reload VS Code after the installation is complete.

## Basic Presentation

Now let's create basic presentation slide with marp.
Create a new markdown file called `slides.md`.

```md

---

marp: true

---

# Headings

## Heading 2
### Heading 3

---

# Basic Formatting

This should be **bold** and *italic*.

**Unorder list**
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

**Order list**
1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3

```

Now if you preview the file,  you should see something like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lCcKc76.png" height="500px" />

## Formatting a Presentation

Let's format our slides.

### Pagination

If you want to add the page number in the slides, then you just simply `paginate: true`.

```
marp: true
paginate: true
```

### Background Color

If you want to set the background color, use `backgroundColor`.

```
marp: true
backgroundColor: orange
```

It will set the orange background color for all slides.

Now, if you want to set background color for a particular slide, then you can set background color to each slide. For example:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qIaVjG1.png" height="600px" />

### Font Color

You can set the font color with `_color` property.

### Image

Including image is one of the important feature in the slides. To add image, simple use `![](image/path.extension)`.

**Resizing image**
```md
![width:100px height:100px](image/path)
```

Even you can use some [css filters](https://marpit.marp.app/image-syntax?id=image-filters).

**Background Image**
```md
![bg](image/path)
```

**Split Background**
You can split background image by `bg` + `left` / `right` keywords.

```md
![bg right](image/path)
```

## Advanced Features

Although there are some limitations in VS code extension, but still you can do some advanced level formatting.

### Header

Let's add header:

```md

---

marp: true
header: 'This is the header'

---

# Page 1

---

<!-- header: Foo -->

## Page 2
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dLXTtHy.png" width="600px" />

### Footer

```md

---

marp: true
footer: 'Some footer text'

---

# Page 1

---

<!-- footer: Foo footer -->

## Page 2
```

### Code

As a developer, surely we add code or pseudocode in the presentation. It would be as easily as like markdown.

### Mermaid JS

You may be wondering as this stage, it would be great if you can able to include [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) in marp.

Unfortunately by default mermaid is not supporting in marp vs code. So you need to enable it by adding following code in the `settings.json` file in your vs code. Check details in [this tutorial](https://laravel-school.com/snippet/how-to-enable-mermaid-or-html-directive-with-marp-in-vs-code-62).

```json
    "markdown.marp.enableHtml" : true
```

This will allow you to write html directives directly.

```md
<div class="mermaid">
graph LR
    A --> B
    B --> C
</div>
```

It will show your output like this:

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR
    A --> B
    B --> C
</div>

Cool, right?

## Export

Now, let's export our presentation. You can export in pdf, html, power point, jpg and png format.

:warning: FYI, some of the markdown does not support in all export format.

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the Command Palette.
1. Type **Marp: Export** and select **Marp: Export Slide Deck** from the list of options.
1. In the next prompt, select the output format you want to use. You can choose from `HTML`, `PDF`, `PNG`, and `Power Point`, and `JPG` format.
1. Specify any additional options, such as the destination folder or file name, if prompted.
1. Wait for the export process to complete. Depending on the format you choose and the size of your presentation, this may take some time.


## Conclusion

So the recap:

- **Simplicity**: Marp for VS Code uses Markdown syntax, which is simple and easy to learn, allowing you to focus on the content of your presentation rather than the technicalities of presentation software.
