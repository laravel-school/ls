In this post, we will learn how to implement the Open-Closed Principle in Laravel. This is the continuation of the previously posted article [ Apply The Open Closed Principle in Laravel | Part 1 ](http://laravel-school.com/posts/apply-open-closed-principle-in-laravel-part-1-28). I highly recommend you to read the previous one before continuing this.

## Table of Contents

## Let's Start
Now, here I want to show the index page for users by using the Open-Closed Principle. First of all, in the `index()` method of `UsersController` you have to instantiate the `CrudRepository`.

[UsersController.php](https://github.com/laravel-school/Laravel-Open-Closed-Principles/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/UsersController.php)
```php

public function index()
    {
    	$crud = new CrudRepository(new UsersRepository());

        return $crud->index();
    }
```

Notice here, I instantiated `CrudRespository` and then put on `$crud` variable. Then I call the method `->index()` from `CrudRepository`.

Now, I will navigate to the `CrudRepository` and create a __constructor__ to inject __CrudInterface__ there. Here should be the code.

[CrudRepository.php](https://github.com/laravel-school/Laravel-Open-Closed-Principles/blob/master/app/Http/Repositories/CrudRepository.php)

```php
protected $crudInterfac;

    public function __constrct(CrudInterface $crudInterface)
    {
        $this->crudInterfac = $crudInterface;
    }
```

Now, I want to show some message from the `index` method in the `CrudRepository`.

```php
public function index(){
        return "Return the view page from the index";
    }
```


Easy, right? So far we have done. Now, if you run your server and then try to access `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users`, you should able to see a plain text-
```
Return the view page from the index
```


Now, let's review. What is the advantage of using repository and interface on the open-closed principle? Legit question, right?

Well, now let me explain why it is better over the procedural way of calling.

Just imagine now, you want to add more __crud operation__ on your system. For example, __category__. In that case, you just need to add __route resources__ in `web.php` file, like this-

```php
Route::resource('users', 'UsersController');
Route::resource('categories', 'CategoriesController');
```

Then, create a controller called `CategoriesController` and then instantiate `CrudRepository` inside the `index` method, like what we did in `UsersController`. Here is the code for [CategoriesController](https://github.com/laravel-school/Laravel-Open-Closed-Principles/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/CategoriesController.php) .

```php
public function index()
    {
    	$crud = new CrudRepository(new UsersRepository());

        return $crud->index();
    }
```

The final thing is to create a `CategoriesRepository` and the code will be like this-
```php

<?php
namespace App\Http\Repositories;

use App\Http\Interfaces\CrudInterface;
use App\User;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class CategoriesRepository implements CrudInterface
{
    // Show list of the user
    public function index(){

    }

    // Show user create form
    public function create(){

    }

    // Store a new user record
    public function store(Request $request){

    }

    // Show User edit form
    public function edit($id){

    }

    // Update user's existing data.
    public function put(Request $request, $id){

    }

    // Delete a user
    public function delete($id){

    }
}
```

Once done, now you are able to access the index method of `CategoriesController` and you will get the output like that.
```
Return the view page from the index
```

In the same way, you can add more and more crud operation for different types of data.

Maybe you can explore more in `show()` or `store()` method that how to implement the Open-closed principle there.
