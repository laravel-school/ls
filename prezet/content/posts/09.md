excerpt: Laravel PHP artisan Route List command
---

Ideally, the `php artisan route:list` will display display the domain, method, URI, name, action and middleware for the routes it includes in the generated table.

## Table to Contents

Now, what if I want to show a route list for a particular url, name or method?

Well, in this case, we can use some Term in Artisan Route List.

The syntax of Article Route list is-

```sh
php artisan route:list --TERM=VALUE
```


## List of Terms

- `--method`: Filters the routes by method
- `--name`: Filters the routes by name
- `--path=`: Filters the routes by path (URI). None
- `--reverse`: Reverses the order the routes are displayed in the table
- `-r`: Reverses the order the routes are displayed in the table (shortcut to `--reverse`)
- `--sort`: The column to sort by. Accepted values are host, method, URI, name, action, or middleware

It will return the output as follows:

**Some examples of the commands are:**

```sh
# Filter the routes and display them in reverse order.
php artisan route:list --method=GET --reverse

# The following is equivalent to the previous example.
php artisan route:list --method=GET -r

# Filter the routes and sort the `name` column.
php artisan route:list --method=GET --sort=name
```

Thank you.
