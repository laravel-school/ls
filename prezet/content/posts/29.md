Hello

Recently I was facing issue to upgrade PHP version 7.3 from 7.1. Well, there are many tutorials online, unfortunately, many of them have confusing instruction. However, I come out with the easiest way to upgrade the php version from 7.1 to 7.3.

## Table of Contents

Upgrading PHP could have two possible ways, `curl` and `brew`.


## Curl
If you want in `curl` way, then in your terminal just write this-
```sh
curl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 7.3
```
Well, in some case, you may need to use `force` also. It should be like this-
```sh
curl -s http://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s force 7.3
```

## Brew

In a second way, you need to use brew. This you need to paste in your terminal.
```sh
brew install php73
```

Once you have done with either one way, the next step is, you have to run the following line in your terminal.

```sh
export PATH=/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH
```

Done.

It works fine in my side. It should work for you.

Thanks.
