Imagine that, you have a __UserFactory__ in laravel project where the email address is `unique`. In general, you can easily add generate an email with faker like this way-

```php
<?php

use Faker\Generator as Faker;

$factory->define(App\User::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'username' => $faker->name,
        'email' => $faker->email,
        'remember_token' => str_random(60),
        'password' => $faker->sha1, // secret
        'remember_token' => str_random(10)
    ];
});
```


But this line of code `'email' => $faker->email` will generate an email for you that doesn't make sure whether it is unique or not. In that case, your testing can be a failure for that.

So, to address this issue, you can use `unique()` method. It will be like this-
```php
'email' => $faker->unique()->email
```

The overall code will be like this-
```php
<?php

use Faker\Generator as Faker;

$factory->define(App\User::class, function (Faker $faker) {
    return [
        'username' => $faker->name,
        'email' => $faker->unique()->email,
        'remember_token' => str_random(60),
        'password' => $faker->sha1, // secret
        'remember_token' => str_random(10)
    ];
});
```

Hope this small tip will be helpful for you.

Thank you.
