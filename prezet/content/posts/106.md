excerpt: The diffInSeconds() function has millisecond rounding issue. This tiny difference has many significant issue in time consuming application. Today I will show you how to solve it.

If you are using laravel and carbon, there are high change to have familiar with `diffInSeconds()` function. This function is helpful to find the time difference between two time in second format. 

**What you need?**
- A laravel application

## Dig into deep

Let's dig into deep about `diffInSeconds()`. Let's investigate this code:

```php
// Move time to midnight tomorrow
$tomorrow = now()->addDay(1)->startOfDay();
// Get time in Second format
$getUntilTomorrowInSecond = now()->diffInSeconds($tomorrow);

now()->addSeconds($getUntilTomorrowInSecond);
```

Theoretically it will print out tomorrow (midnight) 12:00 AM. 

Open the tinker session, and try to run this code. In reality you should see end of today 11:59:59, just 1 second short of tomorrow. 
```php
now()->addSeconds(now()->diffInSeconds(now()->addDay(1)->startOfDay()))
```

It will result like this:

## Scenario

Imagine that you have a command that finds all the users those have birthday tomorrow. So, the command will find all of them and queue a job for tomorrow. 


## Manage command

To create the command, you need to run the following command: 

```sh
php artisan make:command FindBirthdayCandidates
```

In the command, I want to list down all the users who has birthday tomorrow. And then queuing job for wishing them tomorrow.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use App\Models\User;
use App\Jobs\WishForBirthday;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;

class FindBirthdayCandidates extends Command
{
    protected $signature = 'birthday-candidates';

    protected $description = 'Find list of user who has birthday tomorrow';

    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        $users = User::where('date_of_birth', now()->addDay())->get();

        foreach ($users as $user) {
            WishForBirthday::dispatch()
                // Delaying the job for tomorrow
                ->delay($user->date_of_birth->diffInSeconds(now()));
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```

ℹ️ I assume `date_of_birth` returns the `dateTime` / `Carbon` instance. 


## What's happened?

We expect to get the difference between now and birth date of users (tomorrow) in second format. For example, if the difference is 1 hour, it will return 60 seconds as a result from here. But unfortunately it end up the end of the day, [just 1 second short of tomorrow](#dig-into-deep).
```php
$user->date_of_birth->diffInSeconds(now()));
```

Your job actually ended up by today, even without reaching to tomorrow. There is a high change to fail your job. 

## How to overcome

There are three ways to solve this issue:
1. Add 1 second with the birthday to reach to next day.
1. Somehow the job execute exactly at `0` millisecond, which is technically not possible. 
1. Increase number of retry.

### Add 1 second

```php
now()->addSeconds(now()->diffInSeconds(now()->addDay(1)->startOfDay()->addSecond()))
```

The result will be:

### Run in millisecond

```php
$now = \Carbon\CarbonImmutable::now()->setMilliseconds(0); $now->addSeconds($now->diffInSeconds($now->addDay(1)->startOfDay()->setMilliseconds(0)))
```

!["Run in millisecond"](https://i.imgur.com/MWsANiJ.png)

### Increase number of retry

In the job, increase the number of retry.

```diff
class WishForBirthday implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithQueue, Queueable, SerializesModels;

+    public $retry = 3;

    public function handle()
    {
        // Some logic
    }
}
```

Hope it will help you to solve the particular issue. 

Thanks for reading 🙂.
