Hello everyone üëã



Building laravel dashboard will be one of the difficult tasks. The most challenging job for the dashboard is maintaining low amount of database queries, memory uses and processing time. Today, I will show you how to optimize an existing code that has 2882 number of queries for counting some stats and I will achieve the same result with the 2 queries only. 

I found a code that a following output. I just install the debagbar package that help use to count the total number of queries, memory uses and processing time. 

# Summary

| Event             | Amount      |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Number of Queries | 2882        |
| Model Hydration   | 10000       |
| Memory Uses       | 13 MB       |
| Processing Time   | ~11 Seconds |

# ‚ö†Ô∏è My Assessment 
(No blame) It's not an ideal way to write code because the **number of queries, memoery uses, and processing time**.

<details>

```php
$totalman = User::orderby('created_at', 'desc')->where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)->where('created_at', '<=', $todate)->where('gender', '=', 'man')->count();
$totalwoman = User::orderby('created_at', 'desc')->where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)->where('created_at', '<=', $todate)->where('gender', '!=', 'man')->count();
//counts accounts created by admin
$adminAccounts = User::orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->where('createdby', 'admin')->where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)->where('created_at', '<=', $todate)->count();
//counts accounts created by themself
$selfAccounts = User::orderBy('created_at', 'desc')->where('createdby', '!=', 'admin')->where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)->where('created_at', '<=', $todate)->count();
$manAccountsAdmin = User::orderby('created_at', 'desc')->where('gender', '=', 'man')->where('createdby', '=', 'admin')->where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)->where('created_at', '<=', $todate)->count();
$womanAccountsAdmin = User::orderby('created_at', 'desc')->where('gender', '=', 'woman')->where('createdby', '=', 'admin')->where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)->where('created_at', '<=', $todate)->count();
$manAccountsUser = User::orderby('created_at', 'desc')->where('gender', '=', 'man')->where('createdby', '!=', 'admin')->where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)->where('created_at', '<=', $todate)->count();
$womanAccountsUser = User::orderby('created_at', 'desc')->where('gender', '=', 'woman')->where('createdby', '!=', 'admin')->where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)->where('created_at', '<=', $todate)->count();
```

</details>

## Functional Similarities 
I realised that, the above code has some similarities. Here is my assessment:

### 1. Targeting the `User` model
- Each line is querying the `User` model to retrieve some count based on certain conditions.

### 2. Ordering by `created_at` in descending order
- Each query uses `orderBy('created_at', 'desc')` to order the results by the creation date in descending order.

### 3. Date range filtering
- Every query filters users based on a date range:
  ```php
  where('created_at', '>=', $fromdate)
  where('created_at', '<=', $todate)
  ```
### 4. Filtering by `gender`:
- Several queries filter users by their gender:
  ```php
  where('gender', '=', 'man') or where('gender', '=', 'woman')
  ```
### 5. Filtering by creator (`createdby`):
- Multiple queries distinguish users based on who created the account:
  ```php
  where('createdby', 'admin') or where('createdby', '!=', 'admin')
  ```

## Proposed Optimization
So, I propose to use [Mysql CASE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/case.html) in laravel query for 8 queries, which will redecue the 7 query by acheiving it 1 only. Here is my suggestion: 

```php
$stats = User::query()
          ->whereBetween('created_at', [$fromdate, $todate])
          ->select(DB::raw("
              count(id) as total,
              SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as totalman,
              SUM(CASE WHEN gender != 'man' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as totalwoman,
              SUM(CASE WHEN createdby = 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as adminAccounts,
              SUM(CASE WHEN createdby != 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as selfAccounts,
              SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby = 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as manAccountsAdmin,
              SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby = 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as womanAccountsAdmin,
              SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby != 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as manAccountsUser,
              SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby != 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as womanAccountsUser
        "))->first();
```

‚úÖ It literally providing the same result for us by **only 1 query instead of 8**.

## Functional Similarities 
Here I can found following similarities: 

### 1. Date Filtering
Each database query has a consistent filtering on the `created_at` column using a date range:
```php
AND us.created_at BETWEEN '" . $from . "' AND '" . $to . "'
```
### 2. JOIN operation
All the user-based queries are performing a LEFT JOIN between usercities and users tables on userid:
```php
LEFT JOIN users as us on cities.userid = us.id
```

### 3. Filtering by Country
For each country in the $countrylist, the queries filter users based on their current country:
```php
cities.currentcountry LIKE '%" . $country . "%'
```

### 4. Filtering by Gender
Database queries distinguish between male (man) and female (woman) users. For instance:
```php
AND us.gender = 'man'
AND us.gender = 'woman'
```

### 5. Filtering by Account Creator (createdby)
The database queries differentiate users based on who created the account:
```php
AND us.createdby != 'admin'
AND us.createdby = 'admin'
```
### 6. User's Role Filtering
There's a distinction in queries based on what the user wants to be, i.e., sugardaddy or sugarbaby:
```php
AND us.wanttobe = 'sugardaddy'
AND us.wanttobe = 'sugarbaby'
```

### 7. Filtering by Complete Profiles
Queries also filter users based on the completion of their profiles using multiple conditions like:
```php
AND us.aboutme !='' AND us.lookingfordetails !='' AND us.tagline !='' AND us.username !='' AND us.profilephoto !=''
```

## Proposed Optimization
I will us the `CASE` again to optimizat this code. 

```php
User::join('usercities', 'users.id', '=', 'usercities.userid')
    ->select(DB::raw("
        usercities.currentcountry,
        count(users.id) as total,

        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby != 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersmale,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby != 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugardaddy' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersmaleSD,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby != 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugarbaby' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersmaleSB,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby != 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugardaddy' AND aboutme != '' AND lookingfordetails != '' AND tagline != '' AND username != '' AND profilephoto != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersmaleSDcomplete,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby != 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugarbaby' AND aboutme != '' AND lookingfordetails != '' AND tagline != '' AND username != '' AND profilephoto != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersmaleSBcomplete,

        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby != 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersfemale,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby != 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugardaddy' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersfemaleSD,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby != 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugarbaby' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersfemaleSB,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby != 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugardaddy' AND aboutme != '' AND lookingfordetails != '' AND tagline != '' AND username != '' AND profilephoto != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersfemaleSDcomplete,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby != 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugarbaby' AND aboutme != '' AND lookingfordetails != '' AND tagline != '' AND username != '' AND profilephoto != '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as usersfemaleSBcomplete,

        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby = 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as adminmale,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby = 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugardaddy' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as adminmaleSD,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'man' AND createdby = 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugarbaby' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as adminmaleSB,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby = 'admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as adminfemale,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby = 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugardaddy' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as adminfemaleSD,
        SUM(CASE WHEN gender = 'woman' AND createdby = 'admin' AND wanttobe = 'sugarbaby' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as adminfemaleSB
    "))
    ->whereBetween('users.created_at', [$fromdate, $todate])
    ->groupBy('usercities.currentcountry')
    ->orderBy('total', 'desc')
    ->get();
```

‚úÖ Huh, it **redece from 2875 to 1 queries and provide use the same result**. 

This are the major changes that I can optimize from the given code. Here is the output:
