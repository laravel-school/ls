Laravel has a beautiful `each` method that can help you to process a lot of models. Consider that, you have thousands of models, so, don't load them all into memory, but chunk them. Laravel `each` function will help you to figure out in this issue. Let's see how to use each function in Laravel.

## What is exactly each method?
According to the documentation-
> The each method iterates over the items in the collection and passes each item to a callback:

```php
$collection->each(function ($item, $key) {
    //
});
```

## Real life scenario
Imagine that, you have a user model where you have more than a hundred thousand records. Now you want to concatenate the `first name` and `last name` then want to implement uppercase on that. Here is an example of how to do that using `each()`.

```php
$users = User::all();

$users->each(function ($item, $key) {
	$fullName = $item['first_name'] . ' ' . $item['last_name'];

	return strtoupper($fullName);
});

dd($users);
```

The `each` function will iterate over the `users` collection. Firstly it will concatenate `first_name` and `last_name` and then return by making __upercase__ of the full name.

> If you would like to stop iterating through the items, you may return false from your callback:

```php

$collection->each(function ($item, $key) {
    if (/* some condition */) {
        return false;
    }
});
```
