If you are curious to define custom helper function in Laravel, this post will guide you the step by step process that how to create your custom helper function in your laravel application. Out of the box, [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/master/helpers) provides you with many useful and handle helpers such as `Str::slug()` or `ucfirst()` or lot more. Let's know about the process.

## Step 1:
You need to define a helper file what I called `Helpers.php`. You can name it anything and place anywhere. However, I personally practice to place it in `app/Utils/` folder that make more sense to me.

**app/Utils/Helpers.php**

```php
<?php

if(! function_exists('hello_world')){
	function hello_world(){
		return "Hello World";
	}
}
```
Here, I added a new function called `hello_world()` that just return a simple text. You can write whatever logic you need here.

## Step 2
Now we need to register to `composer.json` file. In your `composer.json` file, find `autoload` and register your `Helpers.php` file.

```json
"autoload": {
    ...
    ...
    "files": [
    	"app/Utils/Helpers.php"
    ]
}
```

## Step 3

Finally, run the following command-

```sh
composer dump-autoload
```

and restart your application.

## Step 4
Now you can call `hello_world()` function to anywhere in your application and it will return the `Hello World` test.
