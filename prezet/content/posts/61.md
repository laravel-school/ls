If you want to develop API on Laravel, the [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/master/passport) is one of the best choices for authentication. Today, I will show you practically how to install passport with laravel and then integrate on the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Table of Contents

## How to install Passport
To install passport on laravel, run the following command-
```bash
composer require laravel/passport
```
Then, run-

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

And finally, run-

```sh
php artisan passport:install
```

## Adjustment your settings
To adjust your passport settings on laravel, first, go to the `App\user` model and add the `HasApiTokens` trait by importing the namespace `Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens`.

Your model will be looks like that-

```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notifiable;
use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, Notifiable;
}
```

Then, go to `AuthServiceProvider` and add `Passport::routes` to the `boot()` method. It will be like this-

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Support\Providers\AuthServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;
use Laravel\Passport\Passport;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * The policy mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $policies = [
        'App\Model' => 'App\Policies\ModelPolicy',
    ];

    /**
     * Register any authentication / authorization services.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function boot()
    {
        $this->registerPolicies();

        Passport::routes();
    }
}
```

Finally, go to `config/auth.php` and change `driver` value of `api` to `passport`. It will be like this-

```php
'guards' => [
    'web' => [
        'driver' => 'session',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],

    'api' => [
        'driver' => 'passport',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
],
```

## Code Implementation
Now, let's write some code for that.

### Define your routes
To define routes, go to `api.php` file and add following routes-
```php
Route::post('/join', 'JoinController@store')->name('auth.join.store');
Route::post('/login', 'LoginController@store')->name('auth.login.store');

// This route group is protected. It cannot be accessible without login.
Route::group(['middleware' => 'auth:api'], function() {
    Route::get('logout', 'LoginController@logout')->name('auth.logout');
});
```

### Complete actions in the Controller
__JoinController__

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Api;

use App\User;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Http\Requests\Api\JoinStoreRequest;

class JoinController extends Controller
{
    public function store(JoinStoreRequest $request)
    {
        $validatedData = $request->validated();

        $validatedData['password'] = bcrypt($validatedData['password']);

        $user = User::create($validatedData);

        return response()->json([
            "message" => "User created."
        ]);
    }
}
````

__store()__ method in the `LoginController`.

```php
public function store(LoginStoreRequest $request)
    {
        $credentials = $request->validated();

        if(!Auth::attempt($credentials))
            return response()->json([
                'message' => 'Unauthorized'
            ], 401);

        $user = $request->user();
        $tokenResult = $user->createToken('Personal Access Token');
        $token = $tokenResult->token;
        $token->expires_at = Carbon::now()->addMonth(3);
        $token->save();

        return response()->json([
            'access_token' => $tokenResult->accessToken,
            'token_type' => 'Bearer',
            'expires_at' => Carbon::parse(
                $tokenResult->token->expires_at
            )->toDateTimeString()
        ]);
    }
```

Notice that, I have used Request here for form validation. If you want to know more, [check here](http://laravel-school.com/posts/the-standard-approach-to-validate-laravel-form-request-13)

__logout()__ method in `LoginController`.

```php
public function logout(Request $request)
    {
        $request->user()->token()->revoke();

        return response()->json([
            'message' => 'Successfully logged out'
        ]);
    }
```

## Use Postman to Test.

To test the API, first of all, run-

```sh
php artisan serve
```
Now, I will use the postman. First of all, open the postman and create a new `POST` request and add the following data.

```sh
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/join
```

It will be like this-

It will create a new user.

__Login a User__.

To login a user, create another `POST` request that will be like this-

```sh
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/login
```

If you provide the right credential, it will return the `access_token` for you for accessing the protected route.


Now, let's access a protected route that required login to access. For example, `logout` route, in order to access the logout route, you must need to be logged in.

Let's create another `GET` request for logout.

```sh
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/logout
```

Now, if I hit the URL, I will get the following error message.

```sh
{
    "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```

It's very obvious that we need to be logged in to access this route.

#### Make you Logged in via access token

To make you logged in, you need to pass the access token that you have received during logged in successfully.

Now go to
- __Authorization__ tab > Choose __Bearer Token__ from __Type__ dropdown
- And finally place the __token__.

It will be like this-

After providing the right access token, if you hit the URL, now you should able to get the success message like so-

```sh
{
    "message": "Successfully logged out"
}
```

The output will be like so-

## Testing via PHP Unit.

If you want to test via PHP Unit, then follow the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/passport#testing).

Feel free to ask me further if you have any queries.

Thank you. :)
