Hello.

If you want to use `whereNull()` or `whereNotNull()` in the [Laravel Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/scout#where-clauses), you may get this error `Method Laravel\Scout\Builder::whereNotNull does not exist`. It's because scout officially does not support `whereNull()` or `whereNotNull()`.

Then how to achieve this?

There is a hack you can follow to achieve it. You can use `query()` and pass a closure in it.

For example:

```php
User::search('Taylor')->query(function ($query) {
    $query->where('email_verified_at', '!=', 'NULL');
})->get();
```

This should work.
