You might need to get all the commit lists of a github repo. In that case, you can get the list of the commit of a repo in different command.

May be you can try-

```sh
git log --reflog
```

Or

```sh
git reflog |  awk '{ print $1 }' | xargs gitk
```

However, if you want to get list of the commit in more indexing way, I suggest you to apply the following command-

```sh
git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $(git reflog | awk '{print $1}')
```

It will give you a complete list with with branch and sub-branch. Hope it will help you. :)
