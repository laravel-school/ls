Hey,

I was watching a talk by [Yaz Jallad](https://github.com/ninjaparade) about **I'd Like To Speak To Your Manager**  on [Laravel Meetup](https://meetup.laravel.com/). He explained the manager pattern in a sublime way. I really love his explanation.

If anyone missed it somehow, I just share it for you.
