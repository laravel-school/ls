The [BluePrint](https://github.com/laravel-shift/blueprint) is a package for Laravel to develop component rapidly. The meaning of "Rapid" even you can develop the project without writing code. Incredible, right? This package is maintained by [Laravel Shift](https://github.com/laravel-shift).

According to the docs-
> Blueprint is an open-source tool for rapidly generating multiple Laravel components from a single, human readable definition.

Let's dig into it.

## Table of Contents

## Requirements
- Need to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- Laravel Project.

## How to Install?
Run the following command-

```sh
composer require --dev laravel-shift/blueprint
```

## Blueprint commands
Once you installed, you will multiple commands in `php artisan` for blueprint.

For example-

```sh
blueprint
  blueprint:build      Build components from a Blueprint draft
  blueprint:erase      Erase components created from last Blueprint build
  blueprint:trace      Create definitions for existing models to reference in new drafts
```

First, let's create a `draft.yml` file in our root directory of the project.

## My Requirements
Imagine, I want to build a blog where I need to have-
- A Post model
    - `title` that should be a string.
    - `description` that should be a long text.
    - `user_id` that should be a user id.
    - `published_at` that should be a boolean.
- A PostController
    - index()
    - show()
    - create()
    - store()

## Defining expected components
Now, define the required components in `draft.yaml` file like so-

```yaml
models:
  Post:
    title: string
    description: longtext
    user_id: id
    publised: boolean
    published_at: nullable timestamp

Controllers:
  Post:
    index:
      query: all
      render: post.index with:posts
    create:
      render: post.create
    store:
      validate: title, description
      save: post
      redirect: post.index
    show:
      render: post.show with:post
```

So, you can define your requirement as a human-readable way in the `ymal` file. Isn't that enough readable?

Now, run this command-

```sh
php artisan blueprint:build
```

It will generate the following files-

```sh
Created:
- database/migrations/2020_04_20_101727_create_posts_table.php
- app/Post.php
- database/factories/PostFactory.php
- app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php
- app/Http/Requests/PostStoreRequest.php
- resources/views/post/index.blade.php
- resources/views/post/show.blade.php
- tests/Feature/Http/Controllers/PostControllerTest.php
```

It's basically created as we described in our `draft.yaml` file. Cool, isn't so?

Even, it created relationships in models. For example, our case, a post basically belongs to a user. There should a relationship between `user` and `posts`. Here is our [Post.php model](https://github.com/laravel-school/laravel-blueprint-package/blob/master/app/Post.php). Even it's created test for us [PostControllerTest.php](https://github.com/laravel-school/laravel-blueprint-package/blob/master/tests/Feature/Http/Controllers/PostControllerTest.php). Cool, right?

In our `web.php` file, there is a resource for `post`.

Even it creates some dummy view page in `resources/views/post` folder. Now you can adjust based on your expectation.

It's cool enough,  right?

Surely it is, however, still you have to adjust something in the code. For example, you want to use __flash__ message once the data store.

in your `draft.yaml` file-
```yaml
store:
      validate: title, description
      save: post
      flash: post.title
      redirect: post.index
````

Now, if we look into the `store()` method in the controller, we can see the flash message has defined as tile only. Obviously we need to update like "Post has been stored". We need to do it manually.

```php
public function store(PostStoreRequest $request)
{
    $post = Post::create($request->all());

    $request->session()->flash('post.title', $post->title);

    return redirect()->route('post.index');
}
```

The main purpose of this package to make your development faster, even beyond our thinking. And surely, they did it. A big clap for the development team.

And of course, there are lot more commands available. Check it out in the official repo:
https://github.com/laravel-shift/blueprint

**Alert**: Just want to remind you that, if you don't have knowledge of basic on Laravel, I strongly discourage you not to use this package because it may destroy your learning power. To use this package, you should be at least an intermediate level of developer.

Thank you.
