If you are using git in your computer and facing the issue called **Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.** then, this post might be helpful for you.

To avoid this issue, you need to add `ssh` key in your git account. I consider you are using GitHub. So let's dig into it.

1. Copy the SSH Key
In your terminal,  run this-
  ```sh
  $ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  # Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard
  ```
2. Login to your github account and go to **settings**.
3. Then, click on **SSH and GPG keys**
4. Click on **New SSH key**.
5. Then, in the "Title" field, add a title for the new key. You can add anything you want.
6. Now, paste your key into the **Key** field.
7. Next, Click **Add SSH key**.
8. Finally, if prompted, confirm your GitHub password.

You have done the set-up. Hope it will work for you.

Thank you.
