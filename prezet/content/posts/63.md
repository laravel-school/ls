Today, I will show you how to make your first component with Laravel Livewire. To do so, you have to make sure that, you have installed livewire on your laravel project. If you don't know how to do that, [check this](http://laravel-school.com/posts/how-to-install-laravel-livewire-62)

Let's get started...

Once you installed livewire, you should able to see livewire commands on `php artisan`.

Now, run `php artisan make:livewire PostList` to your terminal that will show a screen like that-

```
 COMPONENT CREATED  ðŸ¤™

CLASS: app/Http/Livewire/PostList.php
VIEW:  resources/views/livewire/post-list.blade.php

  _._
/ /o\ \   || ()                ()  __
|_\ /_|   || || \\// /_\ \\ // || |~~ /_\
 |`|`|    || ||  \/  \\_  \^/  || ||  \\_

Congratulations, you've created your first Livewire component! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Now, hit `enter` to say `no` by default.

By doing so, it just created a class on `app/Http/Livewire/PostList.php` and a view file `resources/views/livewire/post-list.blade.php`.

Now run `php artisan make:model Post -mc` to create `Post` model, migration and controller.

I just added a column on `post` migration like so-

```php
$table->text('body');
```


## Define a Route
Imagine, I want to access all of my posts from the database. So, I will access `http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts` all posts.

__web.php__

```php

Route::get('/posts', 'PostController@index');
```

## Update PostController

In the `PostController`, I just add the `index()` method like so-

```php
class PostController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return view('posts');
    }
}
```


Go to `views/posts.blade.php` file and add which livewire view you want to show in `@livewire()`. For our case, it should be `post-list` that we have created via livewire command.

So, it would be-

```
@livewire('post-list')
```

Let's go to `resources/views/livewire/post-list.blade.php` and define how you show your data.

```php

<div>
    @foreach($posts as $post)
        <p>{{ $post->body }}</p>
    @endforeach
</div>
```


## Update PostList class.
Finally, need to update the `render()` method inside the `app/Http/Livewire/PostList.php` class. Here, I want to fetch all the data from `posts` table.

```php

use App\Post;
use Livewire\Component;


class PostList extends Component
{
    public function render()
    {
        $posts = Post::latest()->get();

        return view('livewire.post-list', [
            'posts' => $posts
        ]);
    }
}
```

Done, now if you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts, you will get the list of the posts.


__Notes:__ Inside the components of the post, you can write your code with Laravel expression. It supports most of the laravel style.
