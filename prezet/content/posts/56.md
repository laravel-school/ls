Today I saw a code where the programmer wants to update a laravel model at the same time, he wants to increment a column's value. Today, I will show you the easiest way how to increment column and update Laravel records.

Just imagine that we have a table called `posts`, that's structure is like that-

__posts__
```mysql
- id
- title
- body
- visits
```

Now, for some reason, you may want to update the `visits` column of the post only where `id` is 1. There are a few ways to do that.

### Way 1
```php
$posts = App\Post::where('id', 1)->update([
	'visits' => \DB::raw('visits+1')
]);
```

### Way 2
Besides that, you can use `increment()` function too.

```php
$posts = App\Post::where('id', 1)->increment('visits', 1);
```

Isn't that easier?

Now, what if you want to find more than 1 post and try to update the `visits` column? You can apply either one style from above for updating more than 1 record.

For example-

```php
$posts = App\Post::whereIn('id', [1,2,3,4,5])->increment('visits', 1);
```

Or

```php
$posts = App\Post::whereIn('id', [1,2,3,4,5])->update([
	'visits' => \DB::raw('visits+1')
]);
```

Thanks.
