If you ever feel in Mac that you hold any key in the keyboard but not repeating fast enough, then you can run this bash script that will help you to increase key-repat faster.


## Key Repart Fast

Create a bash file (e.g. `key-repat.sh`) and paste these lines of code.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 2
defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 10

killall Dock
```

Then give file permission with:

```bash
chmod +x key-repat.sh
```

You should see that your key repeat is fast now.

Do you need it faster? Then change your bash code and then run the file again.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 1
defaults write NSGlobalDomain InitialKeyRepeat -int 10

killall Dock
```

This will make your key repeat the fastest.

Hope it will work for you.

Thanks.
