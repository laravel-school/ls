Hello

Normally we use `db:seed` in Laravel by faker data. However, today, I will show you how to migrate SQL dump file in Laravel DB Seeder.

## Table of Contents

## Step 1
Run migration command-

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

## Step 2
Download your dump file and paste into `database/seeds/source` folder.
```sh
- database
-- seeds
--- source
---- dump_file
```


## Step 3
Go to `database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php` file and include the dump file to migrate into db inside the `run()` method.

```php
ini_set('memory_limit', '-1');

\DB::unprepared(file_get_contents(__dir__ . '/source/dump_file'));
```

** Note**: You can use `.sql` file in the same way also. In that case, you just need to adjust the file extension.

## Step 4
Finally, run the following command-

```sh
php artisan db:seed
```

It should populate data from your `dump_file` to your database now.

Thanks
