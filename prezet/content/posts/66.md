excerpt: If you are familiar with RSS feed based services, surely the first name comes in your mind that called [FeedBurner](https://feedburner.google.com/) that are managed by [Google](https://google.com). Unfortunately, FeedBurner is almost dead because it's been a long time that there is no update. So, what is the alternative of FeedBurner that you can use for your website to send newsletter based on RSS Feed?

If you are familiar with RSS feed based services, surely the first name comes in your mind that called [FeedBurner](https://feedburner.google.com/) that are managed by [Google](https://google.com). Unfortunately, FeedBurner is almost dead because it's been a long time that there is no update. So, what is the alternative of FeedBurner that you can use for your website to send newsletter based on RSS Feed?

Recently I have exactly the same question. I was a bit blur on that since most of such services are paid. However, after googling a while, I discovered a company called [Follow.it](https://follow.it/intro) that will help you to swap your Feedburner services without paying anything. Besides, it offers you an attractive interface where you have a nice admin panel to check the details of your visitors. Check more [here](https://follow.it/docs/publishers/introduction/what-is-follow-it-and-what-shall-i-use-it-for).

## How to install?
To install, you need to have a website, where you need to have RSS Feed page. For my case, here is a feed page looks like- https://laravel-school.com/feed . If you use any CMS like Wordpress, surely you can get it domin.com/feed. If you use any other CMS, just google it the way out.

- First, visit https://follow.it/ni
- Then provide your feed link to __Add the follow feature to your site__. In my case, it will be like that-

- In the next stage, you need to design your form based on your requirement.

- Once you did the design part, in the next page, you will get a code for the form integration. Sample code will be like that-

```
<style>
      @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat:300,400,500,700');
      .form-preview {
      display: block;
      margin-top: 30px;
      padding: 40px 50px 40px 50px;
      max-width: 350px;
      min-height: 200px;
      border-radius: 6px;
      box-shadow: 0 5px 25px rgba(34, 60, 47, 0.25);
      }
      .form-preview .preview-heading {
      width: 100%;
      }
      .form-preview .preview-input-field {
      margin-top: 20px;
      width: 100%;
      }
      .form-preview .preview-input-field input {
      width: 100%;
      height: 40px;
      border-radius: 6px;
      border: 2px solid #e9e8e8;
      background-color: #fff;
      outline: none;
      }
      .form-preview .preview-input-field input::placeholder, .form-preview .preview-input-field input {
      opacity: 0.5;
      color: #000;
      font-family: "Montserrat";
      font-size: 14px;
      font-weight: 500;
      line-height: 20px;
      text-align: center;
      }
      .form-preview .preview-submit-button {
      margin-top: 10px;
      width: 100%;
      }
      .form-preview .preview-submit-button button {
      width: 100%;
      height: 40px;
      border: 0;
      border-radius: 6px;
      line-height: 0px;
      }
      .form-preview .preview-submit-button button:hover {
      cursor: pointer;
      }

      </style><form data-v-16cfb6f2="" action="https://api.follow.it/subscription-form/ZW9GcjRrUU9IMUQ2Vjd5NGJXLzBaZVhKa0x2WnpjMjVhVytLSjhQSVVzT3hBcndnK09aVUNCaTA1MWoyaXZwclpRdmQxcE1wVjN3VVB1eGNmUkdXd0tTMDFTS005SytwaHJuZEpWc0RGTDg3RHVVNWRCL1FTQVM1NkpraWxkV058VVJ6RXc5NmliTE43NnFaVE85OTZuTkNOYWJGU0JLYnNuNnkxcjZjc2kycz0=/8" method="post"><div data-v-16cfb6f2="" class="form-preview" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; border-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); position: relative;"><div data-v-16cfb6f2="" class="preview-heading"><h5 data-v-16cfb6f2="" style="font-family: Montserrat; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; text-align: center;">Get new posts by email:</h5></div> <div data-v-16cfb6f2="" class="preview-input-field"><input data-v-16cfb6f2="" type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email" spellcheck="false"></div> <div data-v-16cfb6f2="" class="preview-submit-button"><button data-v-16cfb6f2="" type="submit" style="font-family: Montserrat; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 16px; text-align: center; background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Subscribe</button></div></div></form>
```

- Now you need to copy the code and paste into the place where you want to show the form.

Now, you need to create a free account and claim your site from there.

## Build your audience.
Once you have set up everything properly, the form should appear in your site from where your visitors are able to sign up for the newsletter.

However, if you have any existing audience, then you can import that form the admin. To import contacts, go to

- https://follow.it/my-feeds/ > __publishing__ section > __followers__.

- You will able to see __import followers__ on right top corner.

- Then finally paste your emails there.

From that section, you can able to see __statistics__ and __settings__ for your site. Based on your requirement, you can adjust it.

If I compare it with FeedBurner, surely I will prefer Follow.it because of its simplicity, real-time update, a wonderful admin panel and a modern UI. Recently I moved my site from FeedBurner to Fellow.it that is entirely free, even if you have 100K subscribers. The basic uses are always free for you.

Hope you will enjoy it. Thank you.
