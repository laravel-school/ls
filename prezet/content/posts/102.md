Hello friends. 

I have been using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) on top of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a primary editor over last couple of years for my day to day job. 
I am really happy to see my progress of using [vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim).  
However I realized inspiring by my colleagues that using vim directly would be way performant for me.
Therefore I decide to use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) as a primary editor. 

In this post I will list down all the commands that I use for my day to day basis work.
