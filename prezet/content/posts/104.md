## Step 1: Create a laravel application
Create a laravel application on your machine by composer.
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel my-app
```

## Step 2: Set email configuration
To send email, we need email sender. It could be any mail service provider e.g. gmail, yahoo. For make it easy, I will use mailtrap. The aim of this application to able to send email from our app.

	```sh
	MAIL_MAILER=smtp
	MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
	MAIL_PORT=2525
	MAIL_USERNAME= # value from mailtrap
	MAIL_PASSWORD= # value from mailtrap
	MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
	MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS= # set the sender email address
	MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
	```

## Step 3: Create a route
In your app, create a route called `send-mail` which allows us to send mail when visit the url.

```php
Route::get('/send-mail', [SendMailController::class, 'index']);
```

## Step 4: Create the Controller

Since we refer the `SendMailController`, let's create it.

```bash
php artisan make:controller SendMailController
```

Let's update `SendMailController`:

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Mail;
use App\Mail\SampleMail;

class MailController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $content = [
            'subject' => 'This is the mail subject',
            'body' => 'This is the email body of how to send email from laravel 10 with mailtrap.'
        ];

        Mail::to('your_email@gmail.com')->send(new SampleMail($content));

        return "Email has been sent.";
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Create mail class
Imagine that I want to send a sample email. Let's create a  mail class.
```bash
php artisan make:mail SampleMail
```

Let's update the mail class.

```php
namespace App\Mail;

use App\Models\Order;
use Illuminate\Bus\Queueable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailable;
use Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Content;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class SampleMail extends Mailable
{
    use Queueable, SerializesModels;

    public array $content;

    public function __construct(array $content) {
        $this->content = $content;
    }

    public function build(): Content
    {
        return $this->subject($this->content['subject'])
            ->view('emails.sample');
    }
}
```

## Step 6: Create mail view page
Let's create a mail view page in `resources/views/emails/sample.blade.php`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title></title>

    <!--
	You can put your custom CSS if you wish
    -->
</head>
<body>
    <p>{{ $content['body'] }}</p>
    <p>Some more text</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 7: Run your code

To check your code, you need to serve your application:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will allows you to run your project in the terminal with: http://localhost:8000/send-mail

## Step 8: Check your email

Now if you go to mailtrap, you should see an email there from your application.

Thanks.
