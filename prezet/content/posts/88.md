Imagine that, you have two fields to validate.

- first
- second

**Validation Rules**:
- The `first` field is **required**.
- The `second` field is required **IF** the `first` field has value and that value is equal **foo**.  Then, set the minimum value is 5, maximum value is 50.


So-

```php

    $validator = Validator::make(request()->all(), [
        'first' => 'required',
    ]);

    $validator->sometimes('second', 'required_if:first,true|min:5|max:50', function ($input) {
        return $input->first == 'foo';
    });

```
