Personally, I work remotely. Working remotely sounds fun, behind the scene, of course, there are many obstacles. In most of the cases, cannot be onboarding since flexibility and freedom.

I found an interesting article about __How I Stay Focused and Productive While Working Remotely__ by [Nicole Peery](https://twitter.com/nicolepdev). She wrote a nice way how to be focused and productive as a remote worker.

She suggested a few resources besides her article. -
